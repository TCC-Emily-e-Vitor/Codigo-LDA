<p>Using my basic knowledge of cryptography and membership websites, I thought of the following :</p>

<li><p>The user buys the registration code on our website. We process payments via stripe, and as a callback the server will create a hashed key based on their email . It will also hash a string based on the browser ID they're using to make sure that the paid version works only on one platform. After that it will save all those hashed keys in a DB by email. </p></li>

<li>Store cart items as a pending order in database</li>
<li>Post merchant ID, payment amount, the return URL, etc. to secure payment page. This uses SSL and I have also posted a hash of the other posted values to ensure they are not tampered with in transit.</li>
<li>Customer enters card info and clicks &quot;Pay&quot;</li>
<li>Secure site redirects to the specified return URL with a query string of relevant transaction information including a flag indicating success or failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the last step, the original site needs to be sure the request came from the payment site so that a user can't just navigate to that URL, providing the query string themselves, to complete an order. I currently have the same hashing mechanism in place to make sure the query string variables are not tampered with. It is very crude. I append the variables into one long string and then append a shared secret key to the end, hash that whole string, send it. The receiving end does the same thing and compares the hashes.</p>

<p>I now wish to create an AngularJS app to run the front-end web application. Product prices for my store need to update every second, so Angular needs to get the product json from the server once per second to update the html.</p>

<p>I wish to somehow do something to protect this publicly accessible json data from being stolen by scrapers / bots repetitively hitting my api to steal my product and pricing data.</p>

<p>My thoughts:</p>

<p>Each json api response contains a random use-once token (i am aware about doing stuff to stop collisions).</p>

<p>This random token is injected via AngularJS into a hidden field within the html page. Angularjs reads the hidden token prior to re-requesting the api and uses this in the header of the next get request.</p>

<p>A json response is only provided with the correct token in the header. Once the token is used, it expires, and any attempt to re-use the expired token, results in that IP address being locked out for a period of time or flagged to administrator to investigate.</p>

<p>Is there a better way of doing the above? Are there any kind of actual available solutions to my problem? Considering that I am paying for the product pricing feed in the first place, I really don't want some schmuck getting it from me for free just because I exposed an api!</p>

<p>However, the team who made the CodePlex project have not created a NuGet wrapper. Someone else has gone ahead and created one, which has gained some traction - 15k downloads at the time of writing. The owner is a personal account, in contrast to the clearly official <a href=""https://www.nuget.org/profiles/microsoft"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Microsoft</a> one used for other Microsoft packages.

<p>Price</p>

<p>Date</p>

<p>Product Name (varchar(25))</p>

<p>We currently only have seven products. Once every business day, seven new data points are added representing the day's price for each product.</p>

<p>On the website, a user sees this information on a page load. Analytics shows that the amount of page loads is about 100 per day.</p>

<p>The website server is an external server to our data center. The data warehouse server is internal to our data center and has other critical data (in different tables) not related and should not be accessible to the website.</p>

<p>The following approaches have been considered:</p>

<p>1) The data warehouse could daily push (SFTP) a CSV file containing the daily data to the web server. The web server would have a process running on a crontab every 15 minutes. It would check if the file had changed. If so, it would update its database with the data. Then, on page loads, the web server would query its database to get the data to display on the web page.</p>

<p>Usually, the push would only be once a day, but more than one push could be possible to communicate (infrequent) price corrections. Even in the price correction scenario, all data would be delivered in the file. The polling process would pick up the change and overwrite the data in the database.</p>

<p>2) The web server could request data from the data warehouse using JDBC or similar SQL connection technology. </p>

<p>However, a security concerns have been voiced. The concern is that by allowing the web server access to our data warehouse, SQL injection attack or some other external attack through the website could compromise the data warehouse. Measures could be put in place to reduce the risk, but the easiest and safest approach has been suggested to simply not allow any public facing system to directly access the data warehouse. In other words, the data warehouse can establish a communication with other servers (say to SFTP the file), but no server can initiate a connection with the data warehouse. Do these concerns seem reasonable and hard to mitigate? </p>

<p>3) A web service could be built, and the web server could call the web service that is hosted in our internal data center.</p>

<p>4) A process hosted in our internal data center could call the web server when it knows the data warehouse has data available. If so, how should this be done? HTTPS with some way to prevent other unauthorized clients from making the same call?</p>

Or, add a 5 second delay each time after the user tried 30 times?  If so, then those special characters won't be that much needed.</p>

<p><code>Id (PK), Filename</code></p>

<p>And a Document database table with the following columns:</p>

<p><code>Id (PK), Name, Description, FileId (FK)</code></p>

<p>When a user wants to ""save"" a Document, my client-side JavaScript does it in two quick AJAX calls (in an attempt to be RESTful and save each resource individually):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Uploads the file they have selected. This will create a File record in the database, and the client will receive its Id in response.</p></li>
<li><p>Saves the Document with the given data (Name, FileId, etc.). This will create/update a Document record in the database.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have a service set up that allows a user to download a file, provided they specify its Id.  However, there is some security logic in the service that checks whether a user has <em>permission</em> to download the file, by checking whether there is at least one database ""entity"" associated with it that the user has access to. For example, a Document would be one such entity. So if a user can access a particular Document (determined by some business rules - but let's just say multiple users can access the same Document), they can download its file.</p>

<p>This all seems fine on the surface, <strong>but there is a problem</strong>. The 2-step save process for a Document is all client-side Javascript, so a hacker could easily modify step 2 so that any arbitrary FileId is sent to the server. This would then associate that file with the Document, meaning afterwards the user will have permission to download it!</p>

<p>What are some ways I can solve this problem?</p>

<p>From my searches iv'e come up with two options. </p>

<p><strong>Option 1:</strong> <em>Using a host to host vpn connection between the two devices.</em></p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> VPN software seems to be well tested and does not require extra programming for the network protocol. The IT department is more comfortable with it because of using software that is already tested and they comfortable with vpn.</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Since my end devices are linux on OMAP platforms cross compiling the vpn software if not already done could be tricky. Dealing with firewalls and routers behind the end devices network. Setup of the connection can be tricky.</p>

<p><strong>Option 2:</strong> <em>Implementing the TLSv1 protocol in my program to deal with the encryption.</em> </p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Does not require extra software to be running on the device. Only relies on the encryption libraries as a dependency. Don't have to worry about dealing with nats and firewalls because the protocol will only require one tcp port to be open.</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Extra coding to the network software. IT is skeptical because our program is responsible for securing the protocol. </p>

Is it feasible to securely store credit card information/passwords/etc on a mobile device? If so, what methods should one take in order to assure the users that the best possible measures were taken to securely store their information. If not, what is a good alternative to store all that sensitive information? Even then, with the stories in the news about user data stored in web sites being compromised what measures should be taken to ensure that the data stored there is also secure?</p>

<ul>
<li>the sites often don't have much ongoing development effort behind them, so the solution needs to be simple to implement</li>
<li>there should be minimal impact on how quickly the page is generated and delivered</li>
<li>it should not be possible for a third-party to spoof reports of changes</li>
</ul>

<p>The approach I'm using at the moment is to give the site developer an SDK that allows them to generate an JSON object using the same data they're using to generate the page. They render this object into a <code>script</code> element in the page, along with an HMAC of the JSON using a secret key. The page also references a small script that pulls out that JSON and POSTs it to my server, which rejects anything that doesn't have a valid HMAC or has a timestamp too far in the past. This prevents most spoofing, except for a small replay window.</p>

<p>To make it even simpler for the site developer, I have considered using a microformat approach where they add attributes to declare things like ""this element contains the price"" and ""this element says whether the item is in stock or not"". Again, my JavaScript would be referenced in the page, but this time it would look for those attributes and build the JSON itself rather than pulling it out of one element. This means no extra work while generating the page, but it has the drawback that there's no HMAC, so it's easily spoofed. Am I right, or am I missing something?</p>

<p>One possible solution is to verify differences by retrieving the page directly, and parsing it on the server side to find those attributes, but I'd prefer not to increase the load on the e-commerce site unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Is there a solution that can use the microformat, but still have a reliable anti-spoofing measure?</p>

"343293","1","","","2017-03-02 08:01:51","","0","216","<p>I'm working on a security concept of a bigger project. It will be done with Spring,but that's actually not relevant right now.</p>

<p>The whole system is a hierarchical tree of computer nodes that run a custom platfrom software, whereas layer 1 nodes connect to a node on layer 2, layer 2 nodes connect to a node on layer 3 and so on.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SkEbV.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SkEbV.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The idea is that the whole system has a master node which will be the root of the tree. The whole user management including authentication will be done there. Meaning a login request from a lower layer node will be forwarded to the root node. The concept for this is pretty much done and looks good.</p>

<p>The difficult part right now is the authorization. The system should give a top down SingleSignOn feeling. Meaning if I've signed on on a layer 3 node, I will not have to sign on on any lower layer node again. Currently I imagine it like this:</p>

<p><strong>Sign on</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>User signs on on an upper node</li>
<li>User gets the session key stored in a cookie</li>
<li>User access a platform on a lower node</li>
<li>Lower node's authorization module does not know the session key provided</li>
<li>Authorization module ask upper node if session key is known</li>
<li>An upper node instance knows session key and responses with an OK</li>
<li>Authorization module on the node with attempted access creates a new local session for this user.</li>
<li>Session key gets added to cookie.</li>
<li>User uses local session key for further access of this node.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Sign off</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>User signs off on a random node</li>
<li>Node on which the user signed off informs the node with the stored original session key, that the session is not valid any more.</li>
<li>The node with the stored session original session key send a broadcast down to inform all clients that this session is now invalid.</li>
</ol>

<p>The whole inter layer communication will be secured of course.</p>

<p>This concept would technically work, I guess. As I never had to create a complex security concept like this, I really d'like to hear another opinion. Maybe I'm overseeing a major issue. Can you see a fatal hole in the story, or should I go with that?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>An important detail I missed, is that a lower layer does not necessarily have direct network access to the top layer. It can happen that the layers are in different networks and only will have direct network connection to next higher layer. Therefore I will not have the possibility to make a central login server as usually used with SSO.</p>

It is advised by OWASP etc.</p>

<p>However I was wondering: what was the earliest known usage of this technique (specifically inside Web URLs)?</p>

<p>I've found a message on Usenet dating from 2003 (for a Java webapp) describing the technique by someone who, obviously, independently discovered it (he's asking for know ""prior art""):</p>

<pre><code>Every single link in any of the jsp page transmitted to the client is 
generated with a checksum that act as a signature for the URL
</code></pre>

<p>The description clearly shows it's a cryptographic checksum being used (and the way it works seems very close to the modern ""tokens"" OWASP advocates etc.).</p>

<p>Interestingly enough the person describing it says that ""it cannot hurt"" but that it may not be that useful since that Java is relatively immune to buffer overflow.  The author couldn't have imagined that this technique would has stopped most XSS and CSRF exploits dead in their track way before these techniques were even invented...</p>

<p>So my question is simple: what are the oldest know usage of this technique you know of?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Upon re-reading the old description, I think in that message from 2003 the technique is even more advanced than the ""per-session tokens"" that OWASP advocates in that every single parameters are checked against forgery (but I'm not sure)</p>

<p>An application stores URIs to be used for file transfers via SFTP, FTP, FTPS and SCP.  Many of these URIs contain passwords, for example:</p>

<pre><code>sftp://someuser:sekrit@host.example.com/
</code></pre>

<p>These URIs are visible to too many people.  We cannot hide email addresses from these people.</p>

<h1>A mini-language to get passwords out of URIs</h1>

<p>Using a mini-DSL, we can specify the parts of the email address we don't want to show:</p>

<pre><code>sftp://someuser:&lt;&lt;CONFIG:customers/widgitco/password&gt;&gt;@host.example.com/
</code></pre>

<p>The program that does the file transfer would look for instances of this mini-DSL in the URI, parse them, look up the appropriate strings from restricted sources, and substitute those strings into the URI.  For example, supposing that restricted source contains this key/value pair:</p>

<pre><code>customers/widgitco/password: moresekrit
</code></pre>

<p>Then, after replacement, the URI should be:</p>

<pre><code>sftp://someuser:moresekrit@host.example.com/
</code></pre>

<p>Each instance of the mini-DSL within the URI would be delimited with <code>&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code>.  Details of the mini-DSL between the <code>&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> would be free to vary in order to meet future requirements; the only requirement would be that it contain no <code>&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>This would achieve my goal of reducing the exposure of these passwords.</p>

<p>Each partner that embeds our script will be given a public key that must be provided when calling the API. An idea would be to ask them to append this key when loading the script, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src=""//initrode.com/widget/loader.js?key=xxxx""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

<p>I've been reading the article and I haven't really grasped it yet. When is the private key given to the client?</p>

<p><strong>Say I have a JavaScript client - where would I store this private key (once assigned) - a cookie?</strong></p>

<p>I think that this maybe is done when authenticating a user, if a JavaScript client makes a post request and authenticates a user, the server validates the input and gives back user id ( a public key ) and then some generated string (stored in a table) = the private key?</p>

<p>And then just follow the approach (quoted) from article:</p>

<pre><code>[CLIENT] Before making the REST API call, combine a bunch of unique data together (this is typically all the parameters and values you intend on sending, it is the “data” argument in the code snippets on AWS’s site)
[CLIENT] Hash (HMAC-SHA1 or SHA256 preferably) the blob of data data (from Step #1) with your private key assigned to you by the system.
[CLIENT] Send the server the following data:
    Some user-identifiable information like an “API Key”, client ID, user ID or something else it can use to identify who you are. This is the public API key, never the private API key. This is a public value that anyone (even evil masterminds can know and you don’t mind). It is just a way for the system to know WHO is sending the request, not if it should trust the sender or not (it will figure that out based on the HMAC).
    Send the HMAC (hash) you generated.
    Send all the data (parameters and values) you were planning on sending anyway. Probably unencrypted if they are harmless values, like “mode=start&amp;number=4&amp;order=desc” or other operating nonsense. If the values are private, you’ll need to encrypt them.
(OPTIONAL) The only way to protect against “replay attacks” on your API is to include a timestamp of time kind along with the request so the server can decide if this is an “old” request, and deny it. The timestamp must be included into the HMAC generation (effectively stamping a created-on time on the hash) in addition to being checked “within acceptable bounds” on the server.
[SERVER] Receive all the data from the client.
[SERVER] (see OPTIONAL) Compare the current server’s timestamp to the timestamp the client sent. Make sure the difference between the two timestamps it within an acceptable time limit (5-15mins maybe) to hinder replay attacks.
    NOTE: Be sure to compare the same timezones and watch out for issues that popup with daylight savings time change-overs.
    UPDATE: As correctly pointed out by a few folks, just use UTC time and forget about the DST issues.
[SERVER] Using the user-identifying data sent along with the request (e.g. API Key) look the user up in the DB and load their private key.
[SERVER] Re-combine the same data together that the client did in the same way the client did it. Then hash (generate HMAC) that data blob using the private key you looked up from the DB.
    (see OPTIONAL) If you are protecting against replay attacks, include the timestamp from the client in the HMAC re-calculation on the server. Since you already determined this timestamp was within acceptable bounds to be accepted, you have to re-apply it to the hash calculation to make sure it was the same timestamp sent from the client originally, and not a made-up timestamp from a man-in-the-middle attack.
[SERVER] Run that mess of data through the HMAC hash, exactly like you did on the client.
[SERVER] Compare the hash you just got on the server, with the hash the client sent you; if they match, then the client is considered legit, so process the command. Otherwise reject the command!

<p>The code I wrote calls a service to get things and to create things. The problem I ran into was that I got null pointer exceptions that didn't make sense. For example, when I ask the service to create an object, I get null back; when I try to look up an object with a known valid ID, I get null back. I spent some time trying to figure out what was wrong in my code; since I'm less experienced I usually assume I've done something wrong, but it turns out the reason for the null returns was security. If the user principal using my service didn't have the right permissions for the target service, then it simply returns null. Most other services here aren't documented very well either, so apparently this is just something you have to know.</p>

<p>This is rather confusing as a developer writing code that interacts with the service. It would make much more sense to me if the service thew an exception that would tell me that the user didn't have the proper permissions to load this thing or to create that thing; I would then immediately know why my service wasn't working as expected.</p>

<p>The more experienced developer who wrote the service argued that asking for the data is not an error condition, and that exceptions should only be thrown in an error condition, not when the user doesn't have access to the data. This data is often looked up in a GUI, and for those users without the right permissions, these things simply ""do not exist"". So, in short: asking is not wrong, hence no exception. Get methods return null because to those users those things ""don't exist"". Create methods return null when the user wasn't allowed to create that thing.</p>

<p>Is this normal and/or good practice? I prefer using exceptions because I find it much easier to know what's going on. So I would for example also prefer to throw a NotFoundException if you asked for an object with an invalid ID, rather than returning null.</p>

Now, this application is not going to require users to login so there is no authentication process involved.</p>
<p>
To be honest most of the rest applications I have developed have been intranet applications so I have not had to worry about scrapping data by others. In the past I have primarily used server side frameworks like ASP.NET/PHP for public facing websites/applications, which would render html output rather than a JSON document.
</p>
<p>
My current concept in mind involves a javascript, running in the browser requesting my WebAPI endpoint for a JSON document to be returned.
Potentially in the future there would also be a mobile application as a client consuming this endpoint.
</p>
<p>
I obviously cannot provide a shared secret to be stored in the client side to generate a authentication token. <br/> I could think of enforcing CORS headers on the servers to only allow requests from my own domain, but then again nothing stops people from viewing the network activity of this website and getting hold of the endpoint and pinging the endpoint directly from their own client.<br/>
I could make use of a short lived access token that my server would hand over only to a valid request from my own website frontend.<br/> But then again nothing stops people from grabbing this token from just refreshing my website and passing on this token to their client.<br/> Also think like host headers, user-agent, etc can be easily spoofed.
</p>
<p>
I could potentially issue a HTTP cookie to my own domain and each time validate http requests against this cookie.
But since I'll also be making ajax calls to the servers my own requests could not be honoured as my scripts also cannot access HTTP only cookies ?.
</p>
<p>
The best I could do is restrict CORS allow-access setting to my domain name, I do understanding preventing scrapping is a very daunting task, but my view is scrapping a api that returns JSON data would be a much simpler task than say scrapping a HTML output from the server.
</p>
<p>
Would you recommend the SPA model with a REST api backend for developing such public facing applications that does not require authentication ?

A brief overview of these tasks: analyze new registrations and posts on a phpBB forum, and delete or deactivate spammers using <a href=""http://www.stopforumspam.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">a website/community that collects such spam reports</a>.</p>

<p>Typically such automation is integrated into the phpBB installation itself, which certainly has its advantages.  My approach has the advantage of independent operation, etc.</p>

<p>One way to think about this is in terms of browser automation.  I've used iOpus iMacros for Firefox (<a href=""http://www.iopus.com/imacros/firefox/"" rel=""nofollow"">the free version</a>) in the past to respond to individual spammers, but current attacks are highly distributed.  My ""logic"" for pigeonholing spammers vs. nonspammers seems beyond the easy reach of the free version of iMacros.</p>

<p>From a more technical perspective one can think about dispensing with the browser altogether and programming GET/POST requests directed to my forum and other Web-based resources.</p>

<p>I'm familiar with some scripting languages like Ruby and Lua, but I could be persuaded that a compiled application is better suited for these tasks.  However in my experience the dynamic flexibility of interpreted environments is very useful in prototyping and debugging the application logic.  So I'm leaning in the direction of scripting languages.</p>

<p>Among browsers I favor Firefox and Chrome. I use both Windows and Linux platforms, and if the tool can adapt to an Android platform, it would make a neat demonstration of skills, yes?</p>

I'm wondering if the flyweight pattern would be a good choice to implement this. I'm not responsible for the implementation right now, as it is just a prototype, and we're not prototyping any parts that need the right system. However, because of the demand for future extensibility to parts that need permission management the interface needs to be solid. This means that in the end it will be a thought experiment, rather than a real part of what I have to work on. However, I do need to be able to explain and justify my design in this area of the application.</p>

<p>In favour of using the  are that you can define permissions by having them symbolized through a token class, as represented in the flyweight pattern. If you're dealing with hundreds of users, this would somewhat simplify the handling and issuing of the rights a user holds, and the required rights a user needs for an action within the system; as well as the memory usage of the rights assigned to all the users.
In the system I have in mind, a factory method of some kind will assign the rights needed at construction time.</p>

<p>As I'm not really experienced with designing with security in mind, I'm having a paranoid line of thought of which I can't determine if it's justified, security wise. A shared pointer could be hijacked by 'evil intruders' to gain rights they should not be getting. This is the major argument against the use of a flyweight that keeps bugging me, Even though the 'how' is undefined, and I wouldn't know how someone would get it done. (no experience in the security mindset, or it's workings. However, I'm not really looking for a lecture in security beyond the secure use of patterns, unless motivated and clearly related to the question)</p>

<p>Q: Is the flyweight pattern a suitable pattern to manage the representation of the rights of a user (or other some 'hand out' type of data) in the design of a software system that needs to be secure by design? Does the use of flyweight objects as representation of permissions pose more of a security risk than other patterns (I could also use a decorator chain for it, even though that would take up more memory) when dealing with permissions?</p>

<p>However, what if my authority <code>VIEW_COMPANY_TRANSACTIONS</code> has other restrictions based on the activity parameters that in fact make the authority effectively <code>VIEW_COMPANY_TRANSACTIONS(companyName=company_a)</code>. I don't want to encode that information into the authority system, and end up with the following new authority:</p>

<pre><code>VIEW_COMPANY_TRANSACTIONS_FOR_COMPANY_A
</code></pre>

<p>The above authority seems to mix up the filtering of the views and the authority itself which makes everything somewhat tedious and inflexible.</p>

<p>In another example, I have the following authority:</p>

<pre><code>APPROVE_TRANSACTION
</code></pre>

<p>which allows the user to hit the endpoint:</p>

<pre><code>POST /company/{companyName}/transactions/{id}/approvals
</code></pre>

<p>But what if the approval can only be done if the <code>transaction.amount &lt; maxAmount</code> in which case, it's even harder to encode this into a new hardcoded authority.</p>

<p>Note that these authorities may also be included in a JWT token, so they must somewhat <em>transferable</em> as well.</p>

<p>What's the best way to design such a system? Any tips?</p>

<p>I want to be able to execute this code safely, i.e. without harmful side effects if it turns out to be faulty or malicious.</p>

<p>More specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the user specifies that the input code should operate on some objects that exist in the primary program (the program that gets the code from the user and executes it). Optimally, it should be able to access these objects directly, but sending them over to the child program through some communication protocol or a file is also fine.</p></li>
<li><p>in the same way, the code should generate some output that is transmitted back to the parent program.</p></li>
<li><p>the user can specify whether the code should be allowed to access any other data, whether it should be allowed to read or write to files, and whether it should have access to any other interfaces or OS methods.</p></li>
<li><p>it is possible to specify a maximum runtime after which the code will be interrupted if it hasn't finished executing yet.</p></li>
<li><p>the parent program and the code to execute may be different languages. You can assume that the programs necessary to compile and execute the given code are installed and available to the parent program.

<p>While gathering infos and studying other code I came across a couple of libraries which implement the option to login the user without having to sign in (these libraries are Tank Auth and Ion Auth, built for the PHP framework CodeIgniter); basically they work on creating a cookie which, in case the user is not logged (session datas are not set) but this cookie is found, it allows them to login nonetheless.</p>

<p>Ok, so far it's clear. What I don't understand, though, is why both library <em>delete</em> the autologin cookie when the user logs out. I mean: I log in, I check the ""remember me"" option (**), I do what I need to do in my admin panel, then I log out; if the autologin cookie is deleted, next time I'll have to log in again by filling the form, ignoring the option I flagged. What's its purpose then? I thought this ""autologin"" would be an extendend login which allowed me to <em>avoid</em> having to fill in the sign in form again. </p>

<p>So I went on and developed my autologin feature, but of course I bumped into the problem of not being able to logout <em>at all</em>, as I'm not deleting it. So I log out, redirect to the home page, then go to the admin panel and the system logs me in...well, it works as expected, but I'm not sure if this is how it's meant to be...How should this be done correctly?</p>

<p>Can someone explain to me how this actually should work? I'm getting a bit confused</p>

<p>P.S. Don't know if this is the right place to ask it, or if SO is a better fit; I'm sorry if I posted on the wrong SE site.</p>

<p>(*) Please don't tell me <em>""don't reinvent the wheel""</em> or any variant of it; I'm doing this to learn and I'm planning to make it an open source project for the public amusement, so I volutarily <em>do</em> want to reinvent the wheel, at the cost of making it oval.</p>

<p>(**) I think I guessed the difference between the ""remember me"" option and the ""autologin"" feature; so far, I didn't consider the first one ( 1-because many browsers ask you to do that nonetheless; 2-because I don't know how to do it right, i.e. how to have the login fields automatically filled without this posing the security threat of having the password stored in clear text inside a cookie), but please tell me if I misunderstood this also..</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/</a></p>
<p><a href=""http://rdist.root.org/2010/11/29/final-post-on-javascript-crypto/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://rdist.root.org/2010/11/29/final-post-on-javascript-crypto/</a></p>
<p>My question is, if browsers truly are inherently unsafe then, by extension, entering any PCI-related info in the browser is unsafe - regardless of JS encryption, HTTPS, or any other security measures? Which would imply that malicious parties should be taking major advantage of this fact, right? Could someone provide specific examples where browser vulnerabilities were leveraged to steal <strong>massive</strong> amounts of PCI-info/PII (by &quot;massive&quot; I mean comparable to the amount that could be obtained by hacking into the hosting servers/DB)?</p>
<p>Also, despite all those posts describing security flaws there's a proliferation of payment services and JS crypto libraries - does that indicate that most companies/communities:</p>
<ol>
<li>are unaware of browser vulnerabilities?</li>
<li>are simply disregarding the underlying issues and jumping on the bandwagon to make some dough?</li>
<li>have weighted the (possibly low) likelihood of someone going through the trouble of exploiting browsers and decided it's still worth to capture payments through browsers?</li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT</p>
<p>Using SSL/TLS addresses some of the issues, but definitely not all. Here are a few notable issues that fall outside of the area that SSL/TLS can solve (quoted directly from the Matasano blog post):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The prevalence of content-controlled code.</p>
<ul>
<li>We mean that pages are built from multiple requests, some of them conveying Javascript directly, and some of them influencing Javascript using DOM tag attributes (such as &quot;onmouseover&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<p>The malleability of the Javascript runtime.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no reliable way for any piece of Javascript code to verify its execution environment. Javascript crypto code can't ask, &quot;am I really dealing with a random number generator, or with some facsimile of one provided by an attacker?&quot; And it certainly can't assert &quot;nobody is allowed to do anything with this crypto secret except in ways that I, the author, approve of&quot;. These are two properties that often are provided in other environments that use crypto, and they're impossible in Javascript.</li>
</ul>
<p>What else is the Javascript runtime lacking for crypto implementors?</p>
<ul>
<li>Two big ones are secure erase (Javascript is usually garbage collected, so secrets are lurking in memory potentially long after they're needed) and functions with known timing characteristics. Real crypto libraries are carefully studied and vetted to eliminate data-dependant code paths --- ensuring that one similarly-sized bucket of bits takes as long to process as any other --- because without that vetting, attackers can extract crypto keys from timing.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, my main point is that, technically, once a credit card number (or some other important piece of info) is entered into a text field of a page there's a chance that it's been compromised - and at that, compromised more easily then if it were entered in the native application.</p>

<p><strong>Our caching logic works in the following way:</strong></p>

<ol>

<li>Validates input, checks if credentials are valid by checking database.</li>
<li>If credentials are valid, creates short-lived access token and long-lived refresh token as mentioned previously.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Response: Same as <code>/register/</code>, returns access token and refresh token in JSON.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>POST /logout/</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Request: Client sends <strong>refresh</strong> token in <code>Authorization</code> header as <code>Bearer</code> token.</li>
<li>Server actions:

<ol>
<li>Validates refresh token by checking refresh token database.</li>
<li>Removes the refresh token from the database.<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> This leaves the access token valid, but since it will be short-lived (1 hour or so, I think it should be fine).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Response: Returns whether the logout request was successfully processed in JSON.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>POST /password/change/</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Request: Client sends <strong>access</strong> token in <code>Authorization</code> header as <code>Bearer</code> token, and also sends old password and new password in JSON through HTTPS.</li>
<li>Server actions:

<ol>
<li>Decodes access token to retrieve the user, and checks the user's old password with the database.</li>
<li>Sets password hash of user in the database to new password's hash.</li>
<li>Removes all refresh tokens associated with user in the refresh token database to essentially log out existing sessions (leaves short-lived access tokens valid).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Response: Returns whether the password change request was successfully processed in JSON.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Questions:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Is this approach secure? Specifically:

<ul>
<li>Is sending the username and password through JSON safe if done over HTTPS? How would I prevent unauthorized domains from making calls to this endpoint? Furthermore, how would I prevent programmatic logins?</li>
<li>Should the refresh tokens be hashed before storing them in the database, or am I just being paranoid?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>If the client were a web browser, how would I securely store the refresh token on the client?</strong>

<ul>
<li>One idea I have for storing the refresh token is: when the user logs in, in addition to sending the refresh token to the client, the server stores the token in an <code>HttpOnly</code> cookie with a <code>secure</code> flag. Authorization will still be done through the <code>Authorization</code> header, but when the client initially loads up, it can send a <code>GET</code> request to an endpoint that checks if the cookie contains a valid refresh token, and if so, return it to the user in JSON. In other words, the only time the cookie will actually be used is to return the refresh token inside the cookie to the client. Is this approach secure? I think it will prevent CSRF as there are no side effects when requesting the refresh token from the cookie, but is there another way an attacker could intercept the refresh token (assuming HTTPS)?</li>

<p>Open source community driven projects provide great value to people, and their development faces significant risks, both from a project standpoint (ranging from wasted developer cycles to failure to ever deliver) and from a product standpoint (users could not like the product, and update could make people leave or a security hole could leave millions of systems vulnerable to a nasty malware attack). Nevertheless, it doesn't quite lend itself to this formula.</p>

<p>Who is responsible for identifying and managing these risks in Open Source community driven projects? How does the team decide which risks are most significant to the outcome of the project? Are there any official standards or approaches in this area?</p>

What I'm thinking is that every action (that requires db access) will have to be authenticated so I'm thinking that when a user logs in (successfully) I'll create an ""auth token"" on the backend, encrypt it and send it to the front end where it gets stored in browser storage so from that point on every time a user does something that token gets used for authentication. But what I'm not sure about how to implement is authentication for user registration (and any other action that doesn't require the user to be logged in, e.g. sending a Contact Us query). For example I could have a ""REST_PASSWORD"" variable in the front-end JavaScript that gets used for these unlogged-in actions but that's essentially useless because anyone can access the JavaScript code and grab the password.</p>

<p>So my question is what is the best way to implement user registration through a JSON REST API so that my application doesn't get taken advantage of by bots/malicious users? It's been suggested that I implement CAPTCHA on the frontend and while I'm definitely gonna give that a look, I'm wondering if that'll be enough security and/or if I need more that?</p>

In the process of creating this document I've been interviewing each engineer to understand their development processes, to make something that's a good mix of helpful in eliminating redundant work, and not overly prescriptive.</p>

<p>Most of the issues I've found there are pretty good solutions for, but there's something that I assume must be a common issue that I can't seem to find a good solution for. That's managing environment variables that are required for local development. For instance, we've got a development key for AWS. It's required to use a lot of functions and features within the application we're developing.</p>

<p>At present the process is pretty bad. Obviously we can't commit an env file to Github as it's sensitive information that we don't want the entire org to have access to. Right now we have a secure S3 file that contains the env file required for development.</p>

<p>We've found that there are a lot of issues both keeping this up-to-date both in terms new env variables making it into this file, and pulling this down during development. It's not very surprising since it's a single piece of the development cycle that's not a part of Github, and it's something that only has to be updated or accessed pretty rarely. That said, when people run into issues it can be very frustrating since realizing that you've got the wrong S3 key, or something isn't a standard kind of error-checking.</p>

<p>Are there any solutions for managing environment variables that people have found work particularly well? We had an employee write a repo that is the best solution we've currently got (<a href=""https://github.com/sihrc/privvy"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/sihrc/privvy</a>), but is there something better?</p>

Customers don’t need an account to buy ebooks so they are not logged in or getting an account.</p>

<p>At this point I’ve got a form for their firstname, lastname and email and a hidden field with the ebook they want to buy. This is the first step. After submitting the form I’m checking if everything is valid. When everything is valid I want to send the data to the server. I want to check the data there as well (you never know if somebody is changing the fronted code). When the server check is done and valid, a push to the database has to be made. At this point, a new entry is made with a unique key. All the time, the user is on a redirected page (something like <code>www.mydomain.com/addNewCustomerInformation</code> (to send information to my server) (Note: the url is a redirect from <code>https://us-central1-&lt;projectname&gt;.cloudfunctions.net/addNewCustomerInformation</code>)) with a loading icon.</p>

<p>Now that the basic information is known and put in the database another redirect takes place to send the user to a confirmation page. First the user has to check if the information is correct, secondly he has to choose a payment option (I’m using Stripe). The options are Alipay, iDeal, bancontact, bitcoin and credit card. So I’m having a more complex system than examples that are only using credit card. Because there are some examples for credit cards, I will go on for iDeal.</p>

<p>When the user has checked his information (It’s not with a confirm button. You can edit your information if there was something wrong.) and clicked on the iDeal button a Stripe source needs to be made and with a redirect the user will be guided through the iDeal steps. The payment part already works so I will skip this. After the payment, the user gets a mail with a 72h link to download the ordered eBook. This is for security sharing reasons. After 72h the link needs to expire (how can I do this?).</p>

<p>So here are my questions:</p>

<p>1) The part were I redirect the user to another url so I can do a post to my server (webhooks), let them wait with a loading icon and do another redirect when I’m getting data back from the server looks very unclean to me. What is a better way to do this?</p>

"240427","1","","","2014-05-18 15:59:04","","1","1899","<p>This is my situation: I have a search results page in PHP where most of the logic resides in a javascript file in order to avoid refreshing the page every time an action is performed. The first thing I do using PHP is filter out and save valid query string values to PHP variables and I make use of the htmlspecialchars function to prevent injection. Now, I'd like to call my javascript function using those variables, so I created a script tag at the bottom of the page in order to pass the PHP variables to it (see my example). </p>

<p>When I put all of my javascript code inside of its own scope (as I read this was a good security practice), I realized that I could no longer call my function from outside of it. I also realize that the javascript method can still be called with anything a hacker wants, so does that mean I can't really make use of htmlspecialchars in my situation?</p>

<p>Here's a stripped-down version of my code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
try {       
  if (isset($_GET[""id""])) {
    if (!is_numeric($_GET[""id""]))
      throw new Exception(""URL is not in a correct format"");
    $id= $_GET[""id""];
  }
  elseif (isset($_GET[""keyword""])) {
    $keyword = htmlspecialchars($_GET[""keyword""]);
  }
}
catch (Exception $e) {
  // handle error
}
?&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div class=""searchResults""&gt;&lt;!-- placeholder --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;?php
  if (isset($id)) { 
    echo '&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;ShowSearchResults(""id"",'.$id.');&lt;/script&gt;';        
  }
  elseif (isset($keyword)) { 
    echo '&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;ShowSearchResults(""keyword"",""'.$keyword.'"");&lt;/script&gt;'; 
  }
  ?&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is basically the js:</p>

<pre><code>function ShowSearchResults(key,value)
{
    $.getJSON(""includes/search_results.php?""+key+""=""+value, 
    function(data) {
      // populate search results
      $("".searchResults"").html( ""search results"" );
    })
    .error(function() { 
       $("".searchResults"").html( ""no results"" );
    });
}
</code></pre>

<p>My questions are (while keeping security and best practices in mind):</p>

<p>Is it bad practice to pass the query string values to my javascript function from within the body? I initially did this because I had the impression that it was not a good idea to extract query string values using javascript. Maybe I'm wrong there.</p>

<p>Should I be extracting the query string values from the $(document).ready function, and then calling the appropriate javascript functions from there? What is the appropriate way to do that (htmlspecialchars equivalent)?</p>

<p>Keep in mind that within my javascript code, I use $.getJSON to call another server side function (in PHP) that can reject anything insecure.</p>

<p>Any insight would be greatly appreciated.</p>

For example, we recently had a conversation regarding encryption of data that we handle for another group that we work with - the data ends up in a database that is on our secure corporate network (I work in a small group in a large software company, so the integrity of the corporate network is very high), along with everything else we handle. Of course, standard guidelines call for ""encryption"" of this data.</p>

<p>Obviously, that could mean many things - IPSec/encrypted connections, encrypted fileshares, encryption implemented in the DB (whole-DB or column), encryption of the actual bits in the file, etc. - and some people in the group are under the impression that the only kind of encryption that really counts is directly encrypting the bits that are stored, the argument being that everything else is too easy to circumvent - ""if the DB is encrypted, I could still log into it and see the data there; if the file share is encrypted, as long as I have permissions to the folder I can just grab the file; but if the bits are directly encrypted, I won't be able to read it"". My instinct says that that statement is based on limited understanding: they can see themselves logging into SQL Server Management Studio to see the data, but since they wouldn't know how to take a stream or array of encrypted data and use a certificate that they probably have access to to decrypt it, it's probably safe. Are they right? Am I right? No one seems to really know, so decisions get based on the opinion of the loudest or highest-paid person.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's just kind of an extended example of what I'm talking about. I feel like it's the blind leading the blind here, with decisions based on limited understanding, and it's frustrating. I'm no expert on the technical bits of encryption, but I know how to use standard libraries to encrypt streams and arrays and the like - where I really need more knowledge is about architecting data security and information on which I can base decisions like the above. Where can I read about this kind of stuff?</p>

So, I was playing around for the past week with any alternative options which would allow error reporting without network permissions and without privacy risks. So I came up with the following:</p>

<p>Errors could be reported through a custom Google Play API, but would only be displayed once more than n users would have triggered the same error and displayed only in the aggregate sense. This (I believe) would prevent exploitation where an app could use this as a method to communicate private data. N would be defined by something along the lines of <code>max(10,number_of_users * 0.001)</code> or something along those lines.</p>

<p>So my question is, would such an architecture be safe or am I overlooking possible exploits? If not it seems a huge waste android lacks such an API as right now virtually every app requires network access for exactly this reason. A similar API could then also be used for rudimentary statistics, once again without the up and downsites of user identifiable analytics like with Google Analytics for android.</p>

In fact, some developers try to include as many information as possible in trace, <strong>making it risky to store those logs, and extremely dangerous to submit them</strong>, especially when the customer doesn't know this information is stored, because she never cared about this and never read documentation and/or warning messages.</p>

<p>For example, when dealing with files, some developers are tempted to trace <strong>the names of the files</strong>. For example before appending file name to a directory, if we trace everything on error, it will be easy to notice for example that the appended name is too long, and that the bug in the code was to forget to check for the length of the concatenated string. It is helpful, but <strong>this is sensitive data, and must never appear in logs</strong>.</p>

<p>In the same way:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Passwords</strong>,</li>
<li>IP addresses and network information (MAC address, host name, etc.)¹,</li>
<li>Database accesses,</li>
<li>Direct input from user and stored <strong>business data</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>must never appear in trace.</p>

<p>So what other types of information must be banished from the logs? Are there any guidelines already written which I can use?</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>¹ Obviously, I'm not talking about things as IIS or Apache logs. What I'm talking about is the sort of information which is collected with the only intent to debug the application itself, not to trace the activity of untrusted entities.</sup></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Thank you for your answers and your comments. Since my question is not too precise, I'll try to answer the questions asked in the comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>What I'm doing with the logs?</li>
</ul>

<p>The logs of the application may be stored in memory, which means either in plain on hard disk on localhost, in a database, again in plain, or in Windows Events. In every case, the concern is that those sources may not be safe enough. For example, when a customer runs an application and this application stores logs in plain text file in temp directory, anybody who has a physical access to the PC can read those logs.</p>

<p>The logs of the application may also be sent through internet. For example, if a customer has an issue with an application, we can ask her to run this application in full-trace mode and to send us the log file. Also, some application may sent automatically the crash report to us (and even if there are warnings about sensitive data, in most cases customers don't read them).</p>

<ul>
<li>Am I talking about specific fields?</li>
</ul>

<p>No. I'm working on general business applications only, so the only sensitive data is business data. There is nothing related to health or other fields covered by specific regulations. But thank you to talk about that, I probably should take a look about those fields for some clues about what I can include in guidelines.</p>

<ul>
<li>Isn't it easier to encrypt the data?</li>
</ul>

<p>No. It would make every application much more difficult, especially if we want to use C# diagnostics and <code>TraceSource</code>. It would also require to manage authorizations, which is not the easiest think to do. Finally, if we are talking about the logs submitted to us from a customer, we must be able to read the logs, but without having access to sensitive data. So technically, it's easier to never include sensitive information in logs at all and to never care about how and where those logs are stored.</p>

We plan to implement role based security so that basically a user can have one or more roles.  </p>

<p>Roles would be broken down by first the module type such as:</p>

<p>-Company</p>

<p>-Contact</p>

<p>And then by the actions for that module for instance each module would end up with a table such as this:</p>

<pre><code>Role1 Example:

    Module   Create  Edit        Delete   View
    Company   Yes    Owner Only    No     Yes
    Contact   Yes    Yes           Yes    Yes
</code></pre>

<p>In the above case <code>Role1</code> has two module types (Company, and Contact).  For company, the person assigned to this role can create companies, can view companies, can only edit records he/she created and cannot delete.  For this same role for the module contact this user can create contacts, edit contacts, delete contacts, and view contacts (full rights basically).</p>

<p>I am wondering is it best upon coming into the system to session the user's role with something like a:</p>

<p><code>List&lt;Role&gt; roles;</code></p>

<p>Where the <code>Role</code> class would have some sort of <code>List&lt;Module&gt; modules;</code> (can contain Company, Contact, etc.).?  Something to the effect of:</p>

<pre><code>class Role{
string name;
string desc;
List&lt;Module&gt; modules;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the module action class would have a set of actions (Create, Edit, Delete, etc.) for each module:</p>

<pre><code>class ModuleActions{
List&lt;Action&gt; actions;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the action has a value of whether the user can perform the right:</p>

<pre><code>class Action{
string right;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Just a rough idea, I know the action could be an enum and the ModuleAction can probably be eliminated with a <code>List&lt;x, y&gt;</code>.  My main question is what would be the best way to store this information in this type of application: Should I store it in the User Session state (I have a session class where I manage things related to the user).  I generally load this during the initial loading of the application (global.asax).  I can simply tack onto this session.</p>

<p>Or should this be loaded at the page load event of each module (page load of company etc..).  I eventually need to be able to hide / unhide various buttons / divs based on the user's role and that is what got me thinking to load this via session.</p>

<p>Any examples or points would be great.</p>

<p>Currently, I send an email with a link and a 5 digit auth-code. The link opens a page, the participant types in the auth-code and is temporarily logged in for the duration of the interview/conference.</p>

<p>From a security standpoint, I think the auth-code is redundant and introduces friction for the participant, who may never have cause to visit my site again and may not be technically proficient. The link I send as part of the invitation contains a random string, so I could just increase its length by 5 characters and have the same size search space for potential attackers.</p>

<p>The downside is that I would potentially have to rate-limit the responses for the invitation URLs, so I'm not sure there's any benefit from a complexity/lines-of-code perspective.</p>

<p>I'm involved in an open source project with several hundred contributors. We publish security notices and vulnerabilities several times a year as part of a regularly scheduled monthly release. We don't publish information about the vulnerabilities until we make the patched version available. We are able to securely manage security issues in our project management system (JIRA). But we haven't got a good process for obscuring the PRs that fix security vulnerabilities as they are submitted to GitHub. We're concerned that people can find these fixes before they are released and create zero day exploits.</p>

<p>We've considered using private repos that fork the main repo, but much of our currently review and QA workflow occurs on the PRs. If we moved the workflow to a security team only private repo, that would reduce the window when the fix is public down to the hours it takes to generate the tarballs and publish them on sourceforge, which would be a big improvement. We'd also likely need to avoid merging the PRs into our public beta.</p>

<p>Before going in that direction, I'd like to know what is the best practice for handling pre-release security bug fix patches in open source projects with open repos?

<p>Now, while considering this, I thought that overcoming webapps limitations (basic widgets, sessions, text/HTTP-based forms, distinct client-side/server-side languages in most cases with a limited communication mechanism, etc.) were a big timewaster, and that maybe traditional GUI development was a better option.</p>

<p>So that brought me to using a desktop app, and then a server part which connects to the database and exposes it via RPC (web services, whatever) to the desktop app, handling security in the traditional webapp fashion.</p>

<p>However, nowadays you can connect to databases remotely securely using SSL, and supposedly databases do provide sufficient role-based authorization (GRANT/REVOKE), so why not connect directly to the database and avoid having to code a server?</p>

<p>Is that a good idea? Are there unassailable problems with this approach?

<p>I was then thinkin the token could be stored on the server and the library requests what the token is and then sends the token to the backend service, but I then have the same problem I'm trying to avoid, how do I make sure only the library retrieves the token and not anyone else. </p>

<p>Is there a recommended best practice for doing what I am trying to achieve. </p>

<p>Thanks for any help you can provide. </p>

<p>My colleague's opinion is that we should make the registration as quick and seamless as possible, therefore we should just ask the user for his email and take care of the rest.</p>

<p>I agree with the intention, but I have a few concerns about it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Since we generate the password, we <em>have</em> the responsibility to make sure the password is strong enough</li>
<li>In my experience, when confronted with an unintelligible password, users are likely to write it down on a post it</li>
<li>The users who do not write the password down, are pretty likely to forget it. Which means they'll have to ask for a new password regularly, and that's not fun for anyone</li>
</ul>

<p>However, considering the general quality of passwords created by users, and the fact that too many people tend to use the same password for everything ('shudders'), I can see how it would make sense to generate a strong password for them.</p>

<p>I still feel torn about it. We are working on a merchant website where the user has the option to save his credit card details, so it is obviously very important that we use most secure approach.</p>

<p>We have the following requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Users should be limited to perform certain roles. e.g. a user should only be able to create/modify/read content that he owns.</p></li>
<li><p>Microservices should be limited to only the permissions they require. e.g. a microservice that only needs to read data from another service should be explicitly forbidden from writing data to that service.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As an example, suppose we have a system where users can upload pictures to an image store service. We have a tagging service that automatically tags pictures with a location. Users can only CRUD their own pictures. The tagging service can read any image from the image store service, however should not be able to modify/delete.</p>

<p>What is a good way to achieve the above using JWT tokens? Some solutions that we've discussed are: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The image store service expose 2 APIs, one that is available externally (giving user CRUD access), and one that is available internally (giving internal read-only access). Seems inflexible - what if another internal service needs read/write access to all images (e.g. one that automatically deletes explicit images)?</p></li>
<li><p>We set up two permissions in the user's JWT, one being CRUD_OwnImages, the other being READ_ForAnalysis. The tagging service can see if the user has READ_ForAnalysis permissions, and if so, make the appropriate request. We have another microservice that checks to see if user has CRUD_OwnImages for CRUD operations on the user's own images. This puts the responsibility on each microservice to ensure that the user is restricted to the actions he requires. The image store has no way to restrict each microservice with this approach, so it is potentially flakey and error prone.</p></li>
<li><p>We give the tagging microservice its own user, with READ_ForAnalysis as a permission. Then, when the tagging service requests images from the image store, it is given access to those, but is forbidden from modifying them. The user's user only has CRUD_OwnImages permission, so he is able to retrieve and get access to only his images from the frontend. If another service needs CRUD to all data, we can give it CRUD_AllData or similar. We like this approach as each service is now responsible for its own data (rather than that logic being duplicated across multiple services), but what if the service requires both user permissions and microservice permissions? Can we send two JWT tokens (both the user's and the microservice's) securely? Is there a way to combine permissions securely and send that through? e.g. the tagging service can read all images but can also write the user's images with the location?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The problem is exacerbated if the user information is needed further downstream (2 or 3 microservices away). Do we just assume that it is up to individual microservices to restrict themselves to the actions that they need, and not make that explicit? </p>

<p>One option that has come to mind would be trying to screen comments for things that are obviously not words, in addition to screening for duplicate comments.

<p>If it was possible to screen out obvious not-text, this could be overcome.

<p>At the very least, you could have posts be flagged for moderator attention if they looked similar but which just had random garbage added in for no reason. This would significantly reduce a spammer's ability to keep spamming, even across multiple accounts.</p>

<li>whenever the server is asked for a client's IP, ask that client if the asker is on their friends list (if not, don't reply)</li>
<li>have each client use some secret key to communicate with the server (so only registered clients will be able to send IP requests)</li>

<p>Have the client ask the server for a friend's IP whenever he wants to start a direct connection with him (keep in mind that the client anyway has to tell the server whenever he's trying to connect to someone, in order for the hole punching to work).</p>

The site would require login for certain functions. Let's also say, for the sake of discussion, you have the ability to create necessary web service methods that would be called from AJAX (for authenticating a user, getting data from a database, etc). </p>

<p>What would be the best way to implement this site? Would there be any advantages / drawbacks compared to building a site using a server side language like ASP.NET or PHP?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1</strong></p>

<p>First, thanks to everyone that has replied so far. I didn't properly phrase my question so I'm getting responses that aren't addressing my question. I've built many sites using traditional methods - a database backend and a frontend that was a mix of server side languages (.NET or PHP) and client side scripting JavaScript / jQuery. </p>

<p>Let's say I'm going to build an environment that has a database server, a web services server, and a web server. My web services server has all the methods I need to interact with the database (authentication, CRUD operations, reporting, etc). The web server does not support any server side languages (like PHP or ASP.NET). </p>

<p>I know it would be possible to build the site entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery). A user could be authenticated via AJAX, the authentication token could be stored in a cookie, and then token could be used on all subsequent AJAX requests. </p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>What would be the advantages / drawbacks of such an approach?</li>
<li>What challenges would be faced with authentication and security?</li>
<li>Would this solve any of the problems typically faced when building a website?</li>
<li>If your boss was asking you to use this environment, would you argue against it? Why or why not?</li>

<p>Keeping that in mind - what's the best strategy to define roles? App will be used by multiple divisions inside our company (every division has it's manager and regular employees), as well as external users, that can be divided into 3 groups (for now).</p>

<p>I'm comming up with two possible solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>each role represents specific action in app</strong>, i.e.: adding new task action is described as <code>task_new</code> role. Selected users get this role to be able to add new task.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>each role represents user ability and every action checks if user has this ability</strong> i.e.: when new task is being added, controller checks if current user has role <code>task_access</code> role.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I <strike>really</strike> somehow like approach to this problem in our current app - there's one place where only admin has access granted, with list of all registered actions. Users are divided into about 10 groups and all you have to do is to check that this group has access to this action. In this case no code-juggling is required, but I'm afraid it will generate some limitations or roles overgrowing in new app.</p>

<p>What I'm really afraid of is spending too much time changing the security code in specific controller/action, I mean, when new user has to get access to specific place, I will have to go to the code, handle new role, code will grow, and so on. I want to keep this time as low as possible, and as flexible as possible. </p>

<p>I believe there are some great solutions to this problem. Am I right?</p>

"360538","1","","","2017-11-09 16:40:28","","0","136","<p>Premise: I'm asked to develop a system that will trace sensitive data. The data are gathered by an intermediate operator (let's call him IO) on an office terminal. The final user (EU) will show up to the office, identify itself via an ID document, the operator will acquire the information and send it to the system.
On request, given the not anonymous ID, the IO be able to consult the history of all the information acquired for that ID.</p>

<p>Objective: store the data on a centralized server in a completely anonymous way using an anonymous ID as an alias of the real ID. I want to make hard even for the technical operators of the server to retrieve the original ID.</p>

<p>My solution since now: as a first step toward the solution I thought of generating a salt hash starting from the password inserted by the IO, and use this salt for hashing the not anonymous ID, then send to the server the hashed ID instead of the real ID (there is the possibility of a hash collision, but, in my scenario it is an acceptable risk).</p>

<p>The problem is that every time the IO will change the password, he will lose access to the history of all the ID inserted (the same, not anonymous ID, will be translated as x before password change and as y after).</p>

<p>An improvement should be that the system will generate a salt on the IO machine at first login attempt, crypt it using the IO password and store it on the server. The salt will be retrieved at every future access, decrypted on the IO machine and used to generate the ID. If the user will change his password it will send, during the normal change password procedure also the hash encrypted with the new password. If the user forgot the password, the procedure to generate a new one will be started and IO will lose access to the history (this is acceptable given the sensitive nature of this data, it will be IO responsibility to store his password in the safest way possible).</p>

<p>At the moment I see a flawless on this procedure, on server side, every time a new encrypted hash will be sent to the server, technical operator will have access to a sequence of encrypted hash, they know this is the same number encrypted with different passwords, this will be a useful information tha will help to crack the salt. How can I protect against this? There are others weaknesses?</p>

<p>But there is more: the perfect solution will allow 2 or more IO to gather data for the same, not anonymous ID, and store it on the server with the same anonymous ID not allowing server operator to retrieve the original ID.</p>

<p>There is a way to achieve this result?</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>PS: as observed in one of the answers one of the challenges of this project is that not anonymous ID are very limited (in the order of billions) and can be easily enumerated.</p>

<li>It doesn't use salts in the passwords. <code>$hashedPassword =  hash('sha256', $_POST['form_pswd']);</code></li>
<li>It doesn't escape user input in SQL queries. <code>WHERE u_password='"".$hashedPassword.""' &amp;&amp; u_username='"".$_POST[""username""].""'"");</code></li>
<li>It doesn't encrypt personal information or financial information.</li>
<li>It doesn't escape user input in HTML output. <code>&lt;input placeholder='Name' type='text' name='form_name' value='"".$row[""profile_name""].""'</code></li>
<li>The database password is hardcoded in the source code. <code>$mysqli = new mysqli(""localhost"", ...</code></li>
<li>The CRUD design does not even have R-Read. There is no display of user info that is entered! I asked to make sure I wasn't missing something. The demo used a sham wrapper of a static CMS page. This is interpreted as ""poking holes in it"".</li>
<li>It has 7 vulnerabilities according to a security scanning app, including XSS and clickjacking. I've shown the report.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I have two ideas:</strong></p>

<p>1) Encrypt the id with the persons authenticated user name as the seed... Then encrypt it again with some private key. When the request comes in I would decrypt with the private key then try to decrypt with the current user name and get the id back. Or perhaps I would combine the user name with the id like username@username.com_[SITEID] then encrypt that with the private key and split them to see if the current username matches the first part. The problem with this though is that it never expires really, so they could in the future make a request even if they have lost access as long as they have the id around.</p>

<p>2) Similar to idea 1, but I would use the session id with encryption as a third key perhaps. The problem here though is if the session expires and they leave a tab open, all the requests would fail from the tab that was left open even though a session is active.</p>

<p>3) Use a cache so that async requests are not affected and just store keys like username@username.com_[VALIDATED_SITE_ID] then see if the key exists when the request comes in and if not, hit the database to establish the validation key.</p>

<p>So I can safely assume security is being applied. Now to the questions:</p>

<p><strong>Question 1: What are the security settings?</strong>
I never told WCF of any membership provider. In fact I don't have any table (SQL or XML) of any usernames &lt;-> passwords. So what kind of authentication is happening? Although WCF Test Client can authenticate as above, SoapUI doesn't pick up these Microsoft .NET defaults and has issues. SoapUI attempts clear text communications and then the server responds with an incorrect security token error.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2: What is the most commonly practiced security model for SOAP 1.2?</strong>
Is it via certificates or username passwords or digest or _____? How are those credentials stored (SQL/XML?) and configured on the WCF server side?</p>

See, the access to the main source repository could be layered and inherently managed by a network of trust, and could still have centralized user management integrating users from an LDAP/Active Directory, while the centralized version control system just relies on the later. With distribution, access could even be given to less users per repository in different countries and maintained easier.</p>

<p>I can see why it is easy to think that having tight &amp; centralized access management to a code repository translates to security, however, that doesn't mean that code cannot be accessed or redistributed other ways. But, is there a real argument/use case/scenario for security where the centralized model is just better than the distributed one?.</p>

<p><strong>Some context</strong>: I'm trying to make the case (with a whitepaper) to my company to switch to a DVCS (I already have other problems identified that are successfully addressed by most DVCSs) and security is one of the arguments I'm expecting to have to justify.

"138682","1","138687","","2012-03-07 17:31:39","","1","689","<p><strong>FIRST, THE SCENARIO</strong></p>

<p>We have an internal system that is effectively split into 2 very separate parts across 2 sub-domains, our back-end administrative system for internal access only we will call this admin.example.com and our public-facing interface for customers via our website - lets call this www.example.com/customers</p>

<p>We have built a series of APIs with PHP in the back-end system for the public interface to access, the APIs are split into multiple files based around the type of activity that is being performed and are also used in the admin interface, these are held in admin.example.com/apis/activity_api.php we have no problems here.</p>

<p>We also have API keys that are in-use, 1 for the front-end and one for the back-end so we can determine access levels without thinking about it. </p>

<p><strong>SECOND, THE ISSUE</strong></p>

<p>Now you know the structure of the application here is the issue, we are using jQuery AJAX to call the APIs but I don't like placing the API keys here as they are publicly visible and anyone with a little programming knowledge will be able to pull a huge range of data, at the same time we need to use them. </p>

<p>Note that the issue is only in the public interface. </p>

<p>What I am thinking of doing is calling a connecting script in PHP with AJAX that is stored locally on our public facing server, this would do a few things</p>

<ol>
<li>Check the referrer, if it comes from example.com/customers/ or www.example.com/customers/ it continues, if not the request is killed with an unauthorized error</li>
<li>Gets the variables posted by the AJAX requests</li>
<li>Restructures the variables for the API (e.g. receives <code>$_GET['request']</code> then reconstructs as <code>$_GET['req']</code>)</li>
<li>Adds the API key that is held as a variable within the PHP to the string</li>
<li>Uses <code>file_get_contents()</code> to make the actual request to the API, this would in turn populate the connecting PHP script with the required returned API data to the site</li>
</ol>

<p>My questions are</p>

<ol>
<li>Have I missed anything in this concept? </li>
<li>Are there any flaws that haven't been thought about? </li>
<li>Are there any compelling reasons why this type of structure should not be used? </li>
</ol>

<p>I appreciate the input! </p>

<p><strong>WHAT I HAVE DONE</strong></p>

<p>I really want to thank you guys for your help and comments on this, you have pointed out what I missed and that was the purpose of posting the question in the first place. You also helped me spot the obvious weaknesses. </p>

<p>I have just written an algorithm that has taken into account HMAC principles. As with anything in this space there is room for unauthorized access but I believe my algorithm minimizes it. </p>

<p>The basic process we're going with is as follows</p>

<ol>
<li>2 keys have been created, a private and public key</li>
<li>The public key is hashed first </li>
<li>A base calculation is carried out on part of the current time stamp</li>
<li>2 random keys for the get request are generated that will be used to transport the access keys, to determine the request keys a mathematical calculation is carried out on the base calculation in step 3, the result is then split into 2 parts, the 2 parts are verified as unique and converted to the final values, 1 part belongs to the public access key and the other to the private access key key</li>
<li>9 unique public values, plus the private access key issued are then taken, they are re-ordered based on a final calculation on the base value in step 3 creating a ""signature"" so to speak</li>
<li>The signature is then hashed and assigned to the private get key generated in step 4</li>
</ol>

<p>On a quick calculation and basic testing, each request will be valid for approximately 27 seconds (give or take a few milliseconds) - enough time to process everything needed but not enough for much more. As the calculations are fairly basic the server load hasn't gone up an inch - I have only tested with 10 connections per second for 5 minutes however, I am going to run a series of load tests on it over the next 24-hours that will range from 20 request per second to 400 requests per second and compare with load test results taken last week. </p>

<p>So what my new algorithm does in a nutshell is disguises the public and private keys by hashing both - however after time the public access key will be obvious unless I assign an algorithm to randomize it, it assigns both access keys random get request keys and has a short validity time based on the request. It doesn't need to store any data in cookies or sessions. In addition, with exception to the login API, all requests are going via a PHP connector that requires the user to be logged in. </p>

<p>I spent more time explaining what I'm doing than actually creating it! </p>

<p>Thanks again for your help guys, it helped me open my eyes a bit more and reminded me about what I had forgotten. </p>

<hr>

<p>I understand the differences between obscurity and security, as well as how the two can work together, but I can't imagine why this would be necessary.</p>

<p>Is there any truth to this, is it just paranoia, or is it just totally bogus altogether? </p>

<p>I can think of ways to do it, but of course it adds a lot of complexity to the application code. Under what circumstances would this be useful? If this <em>is</em> something people frequently do, how is it usually deployed? Hashing the identifiers? Something else? It seems like a lot of work for not much extra security. I'm not looking for real solutions, I just want to get an idea of how/why people would do this in the real world.</p>

<p>Is this really considered a ""best practice"" or is it merely a micro-optimization of little value?</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: I think a few folks might have gotten the wrong idea: I'm not suggesting that difficult-to-guess ids would be the <em>only</em> security mechanism, obviously there would have be the usual access checks. Let's assume those are in place, and that simply knowing the id or hashed id of a record is not enough to grant access.</p>

So when a button is pushed in the web application, the desktop application needs to start running a process (pulling data from the cloud using an API we've created).

<p>Ideally the web application would have direct communication with the desktop application and notify it to begin pulling data down from the cloud using our API.

<pre><code> __________            _____________            __________

     ---------------&gt;  |  Client  |  &lt;---------------
                       |__________|
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Server (Web Files) servers the static files</li>
<li>Server (Data) connects to DB (Data) and servers the encrypted data</li>
<li>Server (Keys) connects to DB (Keys) and serves the user’s data key</li>
</ul>

<p>The process would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Client is served the static files by Server (Web Files) via SSL</li>
<li>Client authenticates using Username/Password with Server (Keys) and gets their data key via SSL</li>
<li>Client connects to Server (Data) and gets the encrypted data via SSL</li>
<li>Client decrypts data using the acquired data key</li>
<li>Client alters the data</li>
<li>Client encrypts the data using the acquired data key</li>
<li>Client sends the encrypted altered data to the Server (Data) via SSL</li>
</ol>

<p>This way each server is isolated, but if someone gains access to Server (Keys), they can work their way to decrypting the data in Server (Data). Is there a way to make this more tight, so as if one of the servers or DBs is compromised, it would not compromise the security of the data?
The current configuration is convenient but not set in stone.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The customized and obfuscated encrypt/decrypt library is out of the window.</li>
<li>The data would be private info and their security is mandated by the government with the very broad and vague “Private information should be protected against leakage and unauthorized access”.</li>
<li>Up until now, the system was isolated and was operated within a closed network, locally (with the same design). We now need to allow broad remote access.</li>
<li>If we turn over the encryption key to the client users, they become responsible for its safety and if they lose it, the data becomes inaccessible. If we need to be able to retrieve the data, we need to save the key on our servers as well (maybe by encrypting it with a master key, and make the retrieval process manual, instead of automatic).</li>
<li>It is back to the drawing board.</li>

In this very page, he goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An even stronger, albeit more complex, prevention method is to
  leverage server state -- to generate (and track, with timeout) a
  unique random key for every single HTML FORM you send down to the
  client. We use a variant of this method on Stack Overflow with great
  success.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But in this post itself, Jeff never remarks about when and how the tokens should be updated.</p>

<p>I was using a similar technique in a web-app I was working on. It works like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Whenever the user will <code>POST</code> data to my server, a csrf token is sent along.</li>
<li>This CSRF token is stored in a cryptographically strong cookie in user's session.</li>
<li>If the token is valid, the user's request is processed and vice-versa.</li>
<li>If the request is valid, discard the old token on server side and create a new token. The response from server contains a new csrf token to be used in the next request. The old token on all the forms on a page is updated with the new one so that the next request is processed properly.</li>

I have read about <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/policies"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Policy Based</a>.
I have read what <a href=""https://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/05/24/dont-do-role-based-authorization-checks-do-activity-based-checks/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">others</a> call <a href=""http://ryankirkman.com/2013/01/31/activity-based-authorization.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Activity Based</a>.</p>

<p>What I want to know is if I do Policy-Based, am I avoiding what Role-Based requires and what Activity-Based seems to avoid - hardcoding security, refactor because of some new requirement, hardcode some more, and so on.</p>

<p>I see the difference between Role and Activity based.  And my goal is to not have groups hard-coded in a method like Admin, SuperAdmin, SuperSuperAdmin, etc.</p>

<p>I think but am no sure if Policy Based does what I want, but I cannot understand how.  How are these three different?</p>

<p>If I use the Under21 example for Policy Based I have seen many times on various blogs, I have:</p>

<pre><code>[Authorize(Policy = ""AtLeast21"")]
</code></pre>

<p>How is <a href=""https://stormpath.com/blog/tutorial-policy-based-authorization-asp-net-core"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> different from:</p>

<pre><code>[Authorize(Roles = ""SuperAdministrator, ChannelAdministrator"")]
public class ChannelAdministrationController: Controller
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>And Activity Based (is this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-based_access_control"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Context Based</a>?) is different but appears more ""semantically"" accurate.  You have an <code>UpdateUser</code> Activity, and it is probably not likely you'd have SuperUpdateUser Activity.  But with policies, it seems you could have the same as multiple roles.  I know there can be many Claims used the authentication and authorization, but all I can think is there might be a better name than Over21 for my policy and create a role that my Claim needs.  But somewhere in the back, I have to create those activities and roles and users.  Even Role Based has policies I can use in .NET Core Middleware, so I am confused.</p>

<p>For example, I could just as easily require an additional policy,</p>

<pre><code>[Authorize(Policy = ""AtLeast21"", ""ExceptInTenneseeWithParent"", ""ExceptInChurch"")]
</code></pre>

<p>Is this my answer (from the MS page)?</p>

<pre><code>services.AddAuthorization(options =&gt;
{
    options.AddPolicy(""BadgeEntry"", policy =&gt;
        policy.RequireAssertion(context =&gt;
            context.User.HasClaim(c =&gt;
                (c.Type == ClaimTypes.BadgeId ||
                 c.Type == ClaimTypes.TemporaryBadgeId) &amp;&amp;
                 c.Issuer == ""https://microsoftsecurity"")));
});
</code></pre>

<p>I am back to hardcoding requirements again.</p>

<p>My question is how are these different?</p>

<p>Additionally, does policy-based security keep me from having to add a new role or policy everytime something new comes along (see my examples above).  Activity based does (it seems).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Why do you believe that Role-Based Security is tightly coupled, while Policy-Based Security is not?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not sure it isn't.  That is why i am asking because something isn't adding up to me.  While this isn't good,</p>

<pre><code>[Authorize(Roles=""Administrator, SuperAdministrator, 
CertainBosses, SomeGuyinHR, SuperDuperAdministrator"")]
</code></pre>

<p>I am not convinced policy is better,</p>

<p>because I have to change my handler with conditionals.  The only thing I can think of is in the Policy-Based you can have a more self-documenting set of code that doesn't change based on a new security role.</p>

<pre><code>[Authorize(Policy=""UpdateUser"")]
</code></pre>

<p>and in your policy you either,</p>

<pre><code>...administrator || some_user || something else
</code></pre>

<p>or some new policy stacked</p>

<pre><code>[Authorize(Policy=""UpdateUser"")]
[Authorize(Policy=""UpdateUserIfYouAreX"")]
</code></pre>

<p>or in the database</p>

<pre><code>...is the user in the database that has my roles
</code></pre>

<p>and change all my role information in the database.</p>

<p>Activity-Based seems most similar to the last policy design:</p>

<p>(from lostechies)</p>

<pre><code>[HandleError]
 public class HomeController : Controller
 {
     [Authorize(Activity = ""Administrators Only"")]
     public ActionResult AdministratorsOnly()
     {
         return View();
     }
 }

It seems to me as if I am just allowing practically every character on the keyboard, and  am forgetting to allow some common characters.</p>

<p>Is there an accepted practice for this situation? Or am I missing something obvious?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I thought of storing the credit card numbers (encrypted), partially or wholly, then saving the CCV number locally on an unwired machine. To bill customers, I would generate temp billing tables, and fire off a form manually for each customer that needs to be billed. I would manually populate the CCV and pipe a form to my payment processor (they will not store the data, unfortunately--only process the payment).</p>

<p>I'm personally aware of how to handle user passwords, and I sent some comments about my concerns through a feedback form (this is a government website. People use other online gov. services which deal with sensitive information, as well as the fact that most people use the same password or handful of passwords for everything (I know I do) and I suspect the same security practices are used throughout) which I got a prompt response for. They simply reassured me that ""the Ministry has taken the necessary steps to protect password information, including storing them with the proper encryptions in place.""</p>

<p>I'd like to just say ""well obviously you haven't taken the necessary steps if you're able to email my password to me"" but I'm not trying to be rude, and I don't think my message would ever reach somebody who knows what I mean anyway.</p>

<p>So I'd like to just state that ""the necessary steps haven't been taken according to [some official security standard]"" which might prompt someone to look into it. I did a quick search on OWASP but only found an article regarding plaintext storage.</p>

<p>Is there a security standard regarding user password handling out there which prohibits (as I think it probably would) storage of retrievable password information? Even better: is there such a standard which <em>must</em> be followed by websites dealing with sensitive information such as banks and government web services?</p>

<li>Client App has an 'ensure(int minutes)' method before lengthy calls, calling token provider if necessary. Let JWT expire if it hits security filter.</li>
<li>Client App sends both JWT and Refresh Token. If JWT expires, use refresh token to get new one and place on response headers via token provider.</li>
<li>Create ""login"" service. Login caches refresh info and returns JWT. Send old JWT to get a refreshed JWT via token provider.</li>

<p>I can think of some ways of handling this:</p>

<p>• Instead of expiring immediately, allow the token to be valid for a certain time period.

<p>This application stores some user information, parts of which are sensitive. For example, if the user configures a proxy, it will store it into a file with encryption. Moreover, my application is calling a web API to execute auto-updates (with a basic authentication scheme).</p>

<p>Currently my application is closed source, and is used in a context that doesn't require high security. The implementation basically contains all the credentials needed to authenticate in the API, or to encrypt user settings. Basically, it contains something like (simplified, it's not ""that obvious"").</p>

<pre><code>String login = ""mysuperlogin"", password = ""mysuperpassword"";
authenticateToApi(login, password);

String encryptionKey = ""mysuperencryptionkey"";
encryptDataToFile(data, file, encryptionKey);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>But</strong>: I know that this way of doing things is not secure at all! I know that it's possible to ""decompile"" Java and see the credentials/methods used by the application, and then use them to gain access to the ""sensitive"" information.</p>

<p>I'm planning to open-source my project this year, so I know I have to get the things done to provide a better security level, here are the options I see:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using <strong>properties filled on build time</strong> to include my credentials directly in the code, without including them into the source: this doesn't solve the ""decompile"" problem</li>
<li>Using a key entered by user to secure every information: I don't like this solution because my application needs to be used with the lowest user ""technical"" intervention. Moreover, this doesn't solve the API credentials problems.</li>
<li>Generate a key from the current system to encrypt data. But in open-source version, it will be possible to find the current system key, and then use it to access encrypted data.</li>
</ul>

<p>I suppose that they are a lot of closed/open source programs that have this problems, but I can't figure out what's the ""least worst"" solution.</p>

<p>So all someone really needs to do is copy the user table and copy the encryption assembly (anyone with database production access) and then they would have access to 100,000 email addresses and potential passwords for them.</p>

<p>I'm trying to explain to the business why this is not a good idea, but the security concepts seem to go over their head as they are not that technically minded (it's for government). Plus there are actually existing functionality within the application for admin users to retrieve user's passwords in order to log in as them and do stuff (which they have said, they require).</p>

<p>So they don't understand the security implications. And in order to implement a stronger security policy (hashing passwords so they can't be easily retrieved), I have to remove existing functionality for them.</p>

<p>What should I do? I didn't build the password system in the first place, so it's not like I can be blamed if anything does go wrong. On the other hand, I don't feel good about it and I also don't want to have access to 100,000 potential email logons.</p>

<p>My peer has developed a suite of Excel/VBA files to take the raw data we get and upload it into a database. Unfortunately, after a code review we identified that the database password was displayed in the VBA code, in plain text, in several places per file. Being in a large enterprise organization we had a number of concerns about those files being available to more than just our team, and the database password being compromised. </p>

<hr>

<p>The problem is, I feel the <em>solution</em> is just as bad, if not worse than the original problem. The plaintext passwords have been removed in the code of all of the VBA files, and an ancillary, helper file was created that requires the user to authenticate through our organizations LDAP system before gaining access to the database password. Being a scripting language (and being Excel), I feel there really aren't adequate precautions in place to secure the users password in the helper file. I feel that now instead of compromising access to a single database, we are potentially compromising access to the logins of anyone who uses these files. </p>

<p>To be fair, my peer has implemented a number of security minded techniques for securing the data in helper file. I just feel each one can easily be circumvented:  </p>

<ul>
<li>locking the VBA code <em>[<a href=""http://www.google.com/#q=vba%20password%20recovery&amp;fp=1"" rel=""nofollow"">google search for vba password recovery</a>]</em></li>
<li>using a custom ""masked"" password entry box <em>[the password box may be masked, but it is still passed out of the box as plaintext]</em></li>
<li>not actually storing the user password in the file itself (he passes it on directly to the LDAP call) <em>[a break point or <code>stop</code> statement can easily reveal the contents of what was passed]</em></li>
<li>setting the sheets to <code>VeryHidden</code> to prevent direct access <em>[append <code>.zip</code> to filename, and ALL data in ALL worksheets is accessible]</em></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>As I'm not one to complain without a solution in mind, our organization already employs Active Directory/LDAP for authentication into our individual machines. My thought is that checking the logged in user (not a full user/password, just the user) against a white list of users on the database should be a sufficient alternative for authentication. </p>

<p><strong>So My Question...</strong><br>
Am I being too paranoid about this? Is there another, more appropriate solution? I am pushing back fairly hard on this <em>fix</em> and I just wanted a sanity check before I start to involve others in yet another solution.</p>

With all the recent news of hacking etc it seems to me that it is nicer that clients have complete control over their data.</p>

<p>The problem is that the data stored is potentially sensitive. What I was going to do was... when a client visits the website there would be a question asking 'are you on a personal computer or a public computer'. If they are on a public computer the site would refuse access.</p>

<p>If they were on a personal computer it would then prompt them to set a password. All their data would then be encrypted with this password. Now obviously this is not too secure. The encryption method would be in JavaScript and their password in plain text so I assume it would be possible for a savvy user to locate the password in the localStorage and access the data.</p>

<p>I feel though that this isn't too much of a problem. If you are using a personal computer the chances of this happening are remote as... someone else would need access to their specific user account on the computer, someone else would need to know about the site... someone else would need to understand localStorage and how to access it. The sensitive data isn't any that will compromise their identity or much else. It just records something most people wouldn't like publicly published.</p>

<p>So really the question is, is localStorage secure enough?</p>

<p>Additional question.. how difficult is to wipe your localStorage? I wouldn't want users to 
accidentally wipe their data.</p>

<p>Finally - is it even worth encrypting / decrypting their data as if you have the password you can access the site..</p>

<p>I ask this because the software I maintain has a rudimentary anti-tamper mechanism. A set of fields from each table are check-summed prior to insertion or updating and the resulting signature is stored in each record.  When the record is next loaded from the database, the signature is recalculated and compared to the signature previously persisted in the database. If the signatures differ, then an alarm is raised.</p>

<p>There are some challenges with this approach, for instance in the event that new fields need to be added to the signature, this renders all existing signatures outdated.  Thus, they either need to be migrated or somehow versioned.  Migrating millions of records is not an option. I guess for me, its a case that the mechanism needs to be reworked to encode the version identifier in the signature.  Additionally this approach won't catch deleted records. The biggest flaw with this approach is that a user with an initial high balance (ideal record state) could transact and replace his/her record back to its ideal initial state after each transaction. No alarm would be raised as the signature does not take into account previous record states.</p>

<p>I have found so many holes with the concept and implementation of this mechanism that its got me wondering, how does the rest of the world handle this? Banks? Insurance Companies? Financial Institutions?<br>
I imagine that keeping ssh and database access on lock-down is entirely sufficient. </p>

I've since replaced the method with hashing a mixture of <code>openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()</code>, the orignal hashed password, and microtime. After doing this I realized that if I were on the outside looking in, I'd have no idea how to guess the token even knowing it was a md5 of rand().</p>

I want to create an extensible platform, where I provide the model and some views, but also allowing third parties to create their own views as well. The idea is that all model manipulation will be done through its API, and only the model will communicate to the (main) server, but users will be allowed to include scripts from other domains that also use that API (those scripts might ""call home"" if they want to though).</p>

<p>I know many sites already do that, for instance when they use a CDN to provide libraries like jQuery. However, I also recall reading that those libraries had to be ""tweaked"" somehow so they won't be mistaken by XSS attacks, though I couldn't find more info on the subject. I have only superficial knowledge of how browsers isolate contents for different domains, and to what extent that isolation occurs, so some pointers in that direction would be very welcome.</p>

<p>I'm also aware of the method of using iframes to load ""less-than-trusted"" contents, and it seems that communication between the main page and its iframes is <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/251420/520779"">quite straightforward</a>. I'd rather not use that method, but will do if there are good security benefits of doing so. However, I'm unsure if that's the case, since the iframe can call arbitrary methods on the parent page... (<em>Edit</em>: from what I understood of Florian Margaine's comment, the method in the linked question only works for same-origin iframes, is that correct? In that case, I can see the security benefits now) Can anyone with experience on the subject tell me how it works?</p>

<p>These are the only options I know of, other suggestions are welcome too. I'd also like to note that, while there must be some level of trust between the user and the third party providing the script (since its very purpose is manipulating the model owned by that user), each user will be free to choose extensions at his leisure (i.e. the available scripts won't be restricted to ones I previously evaluated and endorsed), so any means to mitigate security problems to the users are also welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Let me clarify the question a bit. The goal here is not to make HTTP requests to other domains, merely to have a better control of what the different scripts do to the same page. From what I understood so far of the same origin policy, <strong>different pages</strong> can not communicate to each other unless they come from the same domain, but scripts <strong>in the same page but coming from different domains</strong> can do whatever they want. Is that correct? (if it is, then I guess my question is moot...)</p>

the secret algorithm.</li>

<p><strong>When IP address changes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>On mobile App regenerate the AppKey using the new IP address</li>
<li>Server side will always generate same key because it depends
on IP address of the request</li>
</ul>

<p>The main advantage of this is that the AppKey will always change, which is better than hardcoding 1 application key inside the code, which can be easily stolen by reading request headers. And even if you stole the AppKey from a user you must be using the same IP address where that key was generated.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<h2>Background Information</h2>

<p>I have a CouchDB server (Server B) that is accessed by another server running PHP (Server A). My web app (Client-side Javascript) makes a request for a file to Server A. Server A sends requests to Server B with the access credentials (username:password). Server B returns JSON objects that correspond to matched files, then Server A returns that data to the client. The response includes some meta data about the file and a URL to the file on Server B. The actual file data itself is not included in the response. </p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>The URL to the document attachment included in the JSON response from Server B includes access credentials (username:password). Server A responds to the client-side request by returning those JSON objects. </p>

<p>The client now has this information:</p>

<pre><code>https://username:password@host:port/dbname/path/to/file.whatever
</code></pre>

<p>Currently all data contained within Server B resides in one database instance. If the client has access to the username:password to the CouchDB then all data could be queried with those access credentials. Like so,</p>

<pre><code>https://username:password@host:port/dbname/_all_docs
</code></pre>

<h2>Server-side considerations</h2>

<p>CouchDB on Cloudant</p>

<h2>Client-side considerations</h2>

<p>The Javascript running on the client requires a URL string to the file. The files that are being referenced are KML layers for Google Maps. A new KML layer is created using <a href=""https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#KmlLayer"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> constructor.</p>

<h2>What I am looking for</h2>

<p>Essentially my solution would come if I can provide a link to a CouchDB document attachment without giving the username/password. </p>

<pre><code>https://host:port/path/to/file.whatever
</code></pre>

<h2>What I did</h2>

<p>I had to enable cURL for PHP on Server A.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install curl libcurl3 libcurl3-dev php5-curl
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
</code></pre>

<p>Got a bit of code from David Walsh's <a href=""http://davidwalsh.name/download-urls-content-php-curl"" rel=""nofollow"">blog</a>.</p>

<p>My Javascript client code gets a list of JSON file meta data from Server A. This data includes unique DB IDs and file names (No passwords or API keys). I then pass the document ID and filename to another service on Server A which echoes the value of,</p>

<pre><code>get_data('https://username:password@Server B:port/dbname/path/to/file.whatever');
</code></pre>

<p>I can now serve out the files to the client without revealing username or password for CouchDB on Server B.</p>

<p>There are three different applications <code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> and they all share same user details but I had to implement authentication in each of them which was duplication of effort.</p>

<li>Should I add authorisation login in the same service or create another service with <code>roles</code> and <code>permission</code> tables in it.</li>
<li><p>The end result will be to send a <code>JWT</code> token which would contain payload defining user details and permission so for example:</p>

<pre><code>{
  uid: 1,
  name: '...',
  email: '...'
  permissions: [{
    'edit': ['post', 'user'],

<p>One thing that seemed constant everywhere was that there was a single global SQL Server user account that this application used that granted it permission to the common database, and yes in some naive situations it used the <code>sa</code> user account, which I generally tried to fix when possible.</p>

<p>You can't really effectively hide this username and password that the application uses to access the database.  They're usually stored in an <code>ini</code> or <code>config</code> file, or possibly baked into the executable itself.  In all cases, they're visible to the user if they do a little digging.  In one case we actually used a <code>config</code> file but encrypted it, but of course the encryption key had to be stored in the executable (we weren't naive to the limitations of this, but it did effectively stop people from poking around who were savvy enough to look in <code>config</code> files).</p>

<p>All of these systems had a user-authentication system built into the application, but of course they were all managed through the application itself, meaning the user information was stored in the database.  The application restricted what things you could do based on your access level, but it's all kind of moot if you can just connect to the database and run ad-hoc queries.</p>

<p>I'm interested to know what other systems do to get around this problem.  Here are the options I know of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use SQL Server's security mechanism to maintain a user and roles list, and make the desktop application add and remove users through T-SQL queries.</li>
<li>Instead of connecting directly to the database, create some kind of web service that runs on the server and put the authentication logic in there.  Make every request do security validation.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first options is a bit ugly because you're separating users from the database so users are no longer first class entities and you can't reference them with foreign key relationships, etc.</p>

<p>The second just seems like a major performance problem, and a lot of extra work, plus you can't as easily use ORM mappers like NHibernate (I think).</p>

<p>Does anyone have experience with this?  Best practices?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Thinking a bit more, can SQL Server Authentication actually solve this problem?  For instance, if your user must be able to insert and update timesheet records so you can edit your timesheet, there's no way SQL server can disallow access to other rows in the timesheet details table, meaning you can read and write <em>other</em> people's timesheets too.</p>

<li>Separate web api for that purpose

To be really secure, we can really parse user input because hackers can substitute invalid data even without invalid chars.</p>

Unfortunately, that answer has an important drawback.</p>

<p>Forced inclusion in project settings always includes the forced header <em>first</em>. Unfortunately, most of Microsoft's own system header files are not banned.h compliant, and many third party library headers are also not banned.h compliant. Microsoft claims that <em>their</em> usage of the banned APIs are safe, and has no intention of changing this situation. The primary way to use the system headers, then, is to include them before banned.h.</p>

<p>One way to solve this is to make a kind of meta_banned.h, which includes all possible system headers that are used anywhere in your project, as well as all the headers for any non-compliant third-party libraries, prior to including the regular banned.h. This is the first thing I did, but it causes an unfortunate hit to compile time because some of the third-party libraries have extensive headers.</p>

<p>We ended up with a hybrid approach--the meta_banned.h includes <em>some</em> system headers, and then the project settings for certain exceptional CPP files include the third-party headers as part of the force-include settings on that particular file. This works, but it's ugly and painful to maintain. The per-CPP-file forced includes in particular seem ugly.</p>

<p>What I really want is a method to ensure that banned.h is included <em>somewhere</em> in each file, not necessarily at the top. As long as it's included at some point, I consider the file compliant. If it's not included, I want to generate a build error. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>I am having trouble coming up with an answer that I feel is acceptable.  In light of Sony's embarassing security flaws, I really want to be careful, even though the data being stored on people is of a lower sensitivity.  We are not storing social security numbers or even addresses however we are storing phone numbers, email addresses and a photo of a visitor.</p>

<p>He is concerned that a user can simply Remember Password on a public terminal, then someone can simply jump on this terminal and begin viewing or modifiy data in an unauthorized way.  I am fairly certain however that at least on Windows workstations that the browser will not ""Remember Password"" across Windows user accounts.</p>

<p>Beyond this I am implementing a one way password encryption at the server side (store encryped password in the database, encrypt user supplied password on the server, compare to encrypted string from database).  There are no immediate plans to incorporate SSL encryption however this is still an option.</p>

<p>Are there are any major security flaws with this approach?  Do you have any better suggestions?</p>

One example of this could be a Minecraft Spigot server. You can code plugins and stick them in the plugins folder of the Spigot server. The server then runs and then runs the plugins which interact with the server. Would it be possible to compile it to native code? If so, how (Spigot plugins don't have a main method, which is why excelsior jet won't convert it; is there a way around that?)? And would the plugin interact normally with the Java server, considering that the Java server would have to interact with native code? </p>

<p>One additional question is since the native code ends up running in the JVM, is it any more secure than a normal Java application running in memory? What I mean is when you run a Java application, it's in memory and you can dump the bytecode. Would the native code be any different than if it weren't native?</p>

<p>Am I thinking about any of this wrong? I ask that you also include any references or articles in your answers.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>EDIT: When I'm talking about converting Java to native code, I am talking about using something like <a href=""https://www.excelsiorjet.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Excelsior Jet</a>, explained <a href=""https://www.excelsiorjet.com/internals"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, which is essentially an AOT compiler which also has a JIT compiler for anything that needs to be run on the fly. </p>

<p>My specific questions are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can I convert something that needs to be run by something else written in Java?</li>
<li>Will the converted plugin interact the same way with the server than if it weren't native code?</li>
<li>Is the native code then run in the JVM? Or is it exclusively interacted with by the JVM?</li>
<li>Can the bytecode then be dumped the same way that normal bytecode can be dumped? (<a href=""https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/14675/extracting-classes-from-running-jvm"">example here</a> or by modifying the OpenJDK)</li>

I had a couple of ideas for solving this, but I'm not confident my best solution is the best possible solution.</p>

<p>Solutions I considered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let the browser poll our API through javascript, which in turn polls the third party APIs. This introduces quite a bit of lag between the request and the user seeing the data, but doesn't waste resources on users that rarely log in.</li>
<li>Let the browser poll the third party APIs and afterwards send the data to our API. This is potentially insecure, and requires me to provide extra API endpoints and a lot more data cleanup.</li>
<li>The option I currently consider the most optimal is letting a service on the server (an actual executable) periodically poll the third party APIs. I would, for example, poll some endpoints every 30 minutes, and others maybe once a day. This is the safest option, and introduces little lag to user requests, and prevents users from reaching the request limit of the API. But data will only be up-to-date right after polling.</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously this is a simplified version, and I am looking for an answer which is universal for larger function trees, if possible. </p>

<p>-1: I liked Example #1 because it seemed faster to terminate as soon as it is done doing what it does, instead of returning to the original call to lives out its natural life. Also, Example #1 seems to compartmentalize code, helping to prevent unintended code from executing further on down (which should be detected during testing, but I prepare for the worst). However, this model has proven difficult to maintain, and doesn't seem to scale well. For instance, I had a web page which I wrote to echo out what it was supposed to and then terminate, but this caused problems down the road with making sure that the http headers were inserted before the output; this would require sending the headers as a function parameter.<br><br>
-2: Example #2 seems to maintain a standard order of doing things because not all functions will terminate as soon as possible. Also code can be combined easier without passing additional parameters as in Example #1. However, Example #2 requires more return statements, and will continue out the rest of the program.

<ol>
<li>User enters sensitive data into form, and submits.</li>
<li>Server encrypts data via AES-256 with a strong key that is kept in private source control.</li>

<p>My thinking is that that allows either the client or server to compromised, and things stay secure.  If the client is compromised, then the hacker can read only an encrypted string they do not have the key to decrypt.  If the server database is compromised, the data is simply not stored there so it obviously can't be accessed by the hacker.</p>

"81062","1","","","2011-06-02 15:04:20","","32","10644","<p>Data input validation always was quite an internal struggle to me.</p>

<p>On the verge of adding a real security framework and code to our legacy application rewrite project (which so far pretty much keeps the card-castle-strong legacy security code and data validation), I'm wondering again about how much should I validate, where, etc.</p>

<p>Over my 5 years as professional Java developer, I created and refined my personal rules for data input validation and security measures. As I like to improve my methods, I'd like some hear some ideas from you guys. General rules and procedures are fine, and Java-specific ones too.</p>

<p>Summarized, these are my guidelines (exposed on a 3-tier web application style), with brief explanations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1st tier client side (browser): minimal validation, only invariable rules (mandatory email field, must select one item, and the like); use of additional validation like ""between 6 and 20 characters"" less frequent, as this increases maintenance work on changes (may be added once the business code is stable);</p></li>
<li><p>1st tier server side (web communication handling, ""controllers""): I don't have a rule for this one, but I believe only data manipulation and assembly/parsing errors should be handled here (birthday field is not a valid date); adding further validation here easily makes it a really boring process;</p></li>
<li><p>2nd tier (business layer): rock solid validation, no less; input data format, ranges, values, internal state checking if method cannot be called anytime, user roles/permissions, and so on; use as little user input data as possible, retrieve it again from database if needed; if we consider retrieved database data as input too, I would only validate it if some specific data is known to be unreliable or corrupted enough on the DB - strong typing does most of the job here, IMHO;</p></li>
<li><p>3rd tier (data layer/DAL/DAO): never believed much validation is needed here, as only the business layer is supposed to access the data (validate maybe on some case like ""param2 must not be null if param1 is true""); notice however, that when I mean ""here"" I mean ""code that access the database"" or ""SQL-executing methods"", the database itself is completely the opposite;</p></li>
<li><p>the database (data model): needs to be as well thought, strong and self-enforcing as to avoid incorrect and corrupt data on the DB as much as possible, with good primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, data type/length/size/precision and so on - I'm leaving triggers out of this, as they have their own private discussion.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I know early data validation is nice and performance-wise, but repeated data validation is a boring process, and I admit that data validation itself is quite annoying. That's why so many coders skip it or do it halfway. Also, every duplicated validation is a possible bug if they are not synchronized all the times. Those are the main reasons that I'm nowadays preferring let most of the validations up to the business layer, at the expense of time, bandwidth and CPU, exceptions handled on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>So, what do you think about this? Opposite opinions? Do you have other procedures? A reference to such topic? Any contribution is valid.</p>

<p>Note: if you are thinking the Java way of doing things, our app is Spring based with Spring MVC and MyBatis (performance and bad database model rule out ORM solutions); I plan to add Spring Security as our security provider plus JSR 303 (Hibernate Validator?)</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi I am working on application 2. 
My application interacts with application 1 and 3.
Clients of application 1 need to be to share their linkedin profile information with application 3. 
I have created a simple authorization to linkedin and presented it to application 1 as api. 
I now would want to build :
1) Either data sharing functionality between application 1 and 3 
OR
2) be able to forward authentication request from application 3 and 1.</p>

<p>Goal : is user to be able to share linkedin profile information with consent from application 1 to 3 which are connected by application 2.</p>

<p>It would be great if you could suggest me the best and most secure and easy way to implement this. </p>

<p>Your views will be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm using <code>.gitignore</code> to exclude sensitive content and keeping it (config files, etc) seperately. As my codebase expands into more and more projects, this is becoming quite difficult to manage and I also have no real way to track changes or back up the files properly.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>403</strong>, which says that the client is <em>unauthorized</em>; or</li>

<p>One of the advantages of decoupled components in systems is that you can extend the system without having to touch the existing code.</p>

The other method I tried is encrypting the command packets between the two using AES. However both these methods require storing a secret key on the app and the device. Assuming this goes into production, there will be multiple devices and app downloads. It would be quite insecure to have the same key on all the MCU devices.

<p>For additional reference, the authentication is similar to services like AWS that have a non-secret identifier combined with a shared secret key. I am also considering using HMAC. Also, we are writing the web services in Java using Spring.</p>

<p>I want to set up a system where a user can access his own entries and see the plain text results, but even if he was able to access someone else's they would be encrypted, unintelligible strings.</p>

<ol>
<li>Store username as plain text, and password encrypted with sha1(). Or both encrypted with sha1().</li>
<li>Take the user's password (not the encrypted one, but the one he typed in and use it do define a key specific to that username and password, which will then be stored as a session variable.</li>
<li>Encrypt, or decrypt all of that users data with that key.</li>

<p>In my opinion even if someone gained access to the database and saw a list of plain text usernames and encrypted passwords they couldn't figure out the specific key since it's not stored anywhere.

<p>The EICAR test file was used to functionally test an antivirus system.  As it stands today almost every AV system will flag EICAR as being a ""test"" virus.  For more information on this historic test virus please click <a href=""http://www.eicar.org/anti_virus_test_file.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Currently the <a href=""http://www.eicar.org/anti_virus_test_file.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">EICAR</a> test file is only good for testing the <strong>presence</strong> of an AV solution, but it doesn't check for engine file or DAT file <strong>up-to-dateness</strong>. In other words, why do a functional test of a system that could have definition files that are more than 10 years old.  With the increase of zero day threats it doesn't make much sense to functionally test your system using EICAR.</p>

<p>That being said, I think EICAR needs to be updated/modified to be effective test that works in conjunction with an AV management solution.
This question is about <strong>real world testing</strong>, without using live viruses... which is the intent of the original EICAR.</p>

<p>That being said I'm proposing a new EICAR file format with the appendage of an XML blob that will conditionally cause the Antivirus engine to respond.</p>

<pre><code>X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-EXTENDED-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*
&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;
&lt;engine-valid-from&gt;2010-1-1Z&lt;/engine-valid-from&gt;
&lt;signature-valid-from&gt;2010-1-1Z&lt;/signature-valid-from&gt;
&lt;authkey&gt;MyTestKeyHere&lt;/authkey&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>In this sample, the antivirus engine would only alert on the EICAR file if both the signature  or engine file is equal to or newer than the valid-from date. Also there is a passcode that will protect the usage of EICAR to the system administrator.</p>

<p>If you have a backgound in ""Test Driven Design"" TDD for software you may get that all I'm doing is applying the principals of TDD to my infrastructure.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>the client requests a primary token, by sending the username and password and the current_time (this variable will be saved in the server's database and the client side too) to the api, the server interprets the input, and renders a hashed token (e.g. : 58f52c075aca5d3e07869598c4d66648) saves it in the database and returns it to the client.</p></li>
<li><p>The client now saves the primary token, and creates new hashed token using the primary token + the current_time variable sent in the authentication request (lets call this new token, main_token) also the server does the same and create the same token using the same algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p>Each time the client queries the server API, it sends the main_token to the server, now the server compares the token generated in it, with the main_token sent by the client, if it matches, it means the user is real</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>Second Suggestion: (Dynamic Token)</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>The client generates two random keys ($key1 = rand(10000,90000); $key2 = rand(10000,90000);) On each request on the API, the client creates a hash using the query type, and the two keys with a complex algorithm, and sends these two keys + the hash to the server</p></li>
<li><p>The server, using the same Algorithm used in the client, creates a hash, and compares is to the one sent by the client, if it matches, the server proceeds to deal with the query</p></li>

<p>More in depth example of the scenario...</p>

<p>Lets say my data service is bus schedules. The purpose of the services is for developers to write apps consuming the data. There's nothing personal about the data, it is the same for everyone. The intention is for the developer to write javascript/flash/mobile apps <strong>directly against</strong> the api (I'm aware of cross domain restrictions). But the developer has to pay when users of his app make requests against the bus schedule api. How do I keep another developer going to the original developer's site and just lifting the credentials that are used by his browser to talk to the bus schedule api, and writing his own app using those credentials?</p>

While I was working (back in the Dark Ages) stored procedures were viewed as poor practice, mainly because they were seen as less maintainable; less testable; highly coupled; and locked a system into one vendor; (<a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/65742/stored-procedures-a-bad-practice-at-one-of-worlds-largest-it-software-consulting/65748#65748"">this question</a> covers some other reasons).</p>

<p>Although when I was working, projects were virtually unaware of the possibility of such attacks; various rules were adopted to secure the database against corruption of various sorts. These rules can be summarised as:</p>

<ol>
<li>No client/application had direct access to the database tables.</li>
<li>All accesses to all tables were through views (and all the updates to the base tables were done through triggers).</li>
<li>All data items had a domain specified.</li>
<li>No data item was permitted to be nullable - this had implications that had the DBAs grinding their teeth on occasion; but was enforced.</li>
<li>Roles and permissions were set up appropriately - for instance, a restricted role to give only views the right to change the data.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>So is a set of (enforced) rules such as this (though not necessarily this particular set) an appropriate alternative to parametrized queries in preventing SQL injection attacks? If not, why not? Can a database be secured against such attacks by database (only) specific measures?</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Emphasis of the question changed slightly, in the light of the initial responses received. Base question unchanged.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2</strong></p>

<p>The approach of relying on paramaterized queries seems to be only a peripheral step in 
defense against attacks on systems. It seems to me that more fundamental defenses are both desirable, and may render reliance on such queries not necessary, or less critical, even to defend specifically against injection attacks.</p>

<p>The approach implicit in my question was based on ""armouring"" the database and I had no idea whether it was a viable option. Further research has suggested that there are such approaches. I have found the following sources that provide some pointers to this type of approach:</p>

<p><a href=""http://database-programmer.blogspot.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://database-programmer.blogspot.com</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://thehelsinkideclaration.blogspot.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://thehelsinkideclaration.blogspot.com</a></p>

<p>The principle features I have taken from these sources is:</p>

<ol>
<li>An extensive data dictionary, combined with an extensive security data dictionary</li>
<li>Generation of triggers, queries and constraints from the data dictionary</li>
<li>Minimize Code and maximize data</li>
</ol>

<p>While the answers I have had so far are very useful and point out difficulties arising from disregarding paramaterized queries, ultimately they do not answer my original question(s) (now emphasised in bold). </p>

<p>For example let's say that my webapp (I've got Java in mind but this applies to any backend really) has a secure authentication system that allows users of the API to login with a username and password. When the user makes a request, at any point during the request processing pipeline I can call a <code>getAuthenticatedUser()</code> method which will return either the null user if the user isn't logged in, or a User domain object that represents the logged in user. </p>

<p>The API allows authenticated users to access their data e.g. a GET to <code>/api/orders/</code> will return that user's list of orders. Similarly, a GET to <code>/api/tasks/{task_id}</code> will return data relating to that specific task.</p>

<p>Let's assume that there are a number of different domain objects that can be associated with a user's account (orders and tasks are two examples, we could also have customers, invoices etc.). We only want authenticated users to be able to access data about their own objects so when a user makes a call to <code>/api/invoices/{invoice_id}</code> we need to check that the user is authorized to access that resource before we serve it up. </p>

<p>My question is then, do patterns or strategies exist to deal with this authorization problem? One option I'm considering is creating a helper interface (i.e. <code>SecurityUtils.isUserAuthorized(user, object)</code>), which can be called during request processing to ensure that the user is authorized to fetch the object. This isn't ideal as it pollutes the application endpoint code with lots of these calls e.g.</p>

<pre><code>Object someEndpoint(int objectId) {
    if (!SecurityUtils.isUserAuthorized(loggedInUser, objectDAO.get(objectId)) {
        throw new UnauthorizedException();
    }
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>...and then there's the question of implementing this method for every domain type which could be a bit of a pain. This might be the only option but I'd be interested to hear your suggestions!</p>

<p>And noticed that nobody mentioned this particular attribute. It's something I find useful- whenever any logging is added to the system as a result of tracing a particular issue raised in the bug tracker, or adding a feature, <strong><em>I tend to include the ticket number of the related helpdesk element.</em></strong></p>

<p>This means that when going through the log, any programmer can cross reference each log message with the associated ticket number. Now I understand that using proper VCS/helpdesk integration means most commits are attached to a ticket number anyway- but over time it makes it easy for us to diagnose problems on inspection whenever a log message comes up. </p>

<p>All services will be used by our internal applications, but we have plans to expose it to public.</p>

<p>One of the services would be identity management service, which would be responsible for issuing and validating tokens.</p>

<p>For shared references, we are using SharedKernel. One of libraries in shared kernel is a custom <code>AuthorizationAttribute</code>, which will be used by all micro-services. Basically what the attribute does, is forwarding Bearer token to authorization service, and authorization service responds with information such as token validity, user information and a set off allowed endpoints/resources for the given token.</p>

<p>If the current endpoint is not listed, 401 HTTP response is returned.</p>

<ol>
<li>Are we on the right track and is this a valid approach? If not, what can be done to improve it?</li>
<li>We are still having problems with UserTypes/Roles concept. We will probably have 3 types of users. Admins, Agents and End-Users and yet again, if some 3rd party company decides to use our API, roles which were created for our needs, might not be suitable for their needs.
The problem is that not all agents will have set of same permissions. For an example we might have an agent who is responsible for accounting and he would have access only to accounting related micro-services, but we might also have an agent who is responsible only for booking. Should this require us to set a UserType for each agent type, fe. AccountingAgent, BookingAgent etc, and assign multiple <code>UserTypes</code> to user, or there is a simpler approach to solve this? </li>

<p>We are unsure how to handle roles and scopes. The idea is to create 3 basic user roles such as Admins, Agents and End-Users and let the consumer apps to fine-tune scopes if needed.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Admins</strong> can create, update, read and delete all
resources by default (for their company). </li>
<li><strong>Agents</strong> can create, update and read data for their company. </li>
<li><strong>End-Users</strong> can create, update, delete and read data, but cannot access same endpoints as agents or admins. They will also be able to create or modify data, just not on a same level as agents or admins. For example, end users can update or read their account info, same as agent will be able to do it for them, but they can't see or update admin notes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's say that agents by default can create, read and update each resource for their company and that is their maximum scope which can be requested for their token/session, but developers of client (API consumer) application have decided that one of their agents can read and create only certain resources.</p>

<p>Is it a better practice to handle this in our internal security, and let them write that data in our database, or let clients handle that internally by requesting a token with lesser scope, and let them write which agent will have which scope in their database? This way we would have to track only token scopes.</p>

<p>The downside of this, is that our team would also need to create fine-tuned access mechanisms in our internal applications.</p>

<p>With this way of thinking, micro-services and their authorization system should not be bothered with clients needs, because they are only consumers and not part of the system (even though some of those consumers are our own internal apps)?</p>

<li>Encourage people to throw off the yoke of dependency on fixed third parties for emails as well as website hosting, chatting, etc. by getting their own domains. One wouldn't want a phone number like 555-123-1234@att.com because one could not freely change providers. And there are no doubt many would-be content creators who would share more freely if they had a site belonging to them. If one wanted to be anonymous, one could reserve domains like anonymous567.name (e.g., me@anonymous567.name) -- and this would be fine with me as my purpose is not to positively ID people outside of the context of confirming they control the email address they give me but to raise barriers to spammers. It would add a small price to do content creation on the site as users would have to purchase a domain and configure email on it and would cost more so to become truly anonymous (e.g., to purchase separate domains for each site to avoid tracking between sites), but I think the burden should not lie on content websites to deal with spam registrations.</li>

Well, I met with my first client and they are requesting a relatively simple, custom system that (without being long winded) tracks client’s paperwork as it progresses through the business’s different manual processes.  </p>

<p>It is a small business that has about 10 employees, but all of the employees will interact with the client’s paperwork, therefore everyone would need access to the new system. When I say <strong>track</strong> I literally mean that the employees will <strong>check as complete</strong> on a simple page the increases a progress bar at different stages for the paperwork.  </p>

<p>Now I am %110 capable of coding the custom system that meets their needs, but I am unsure about how I should go about doing it.
The information that is being tracked in the new system and stored in the DB is confidential information that they are very protective of. My main question is how should I be developing this to be as secure as I can?</p>

<ul>
<li>They have their own server in house, so should I develop an application (VB and SQL) for the server and require employees to log on remotely to use it? Can more than one person access/use the application at a time?</li>
<li>Or should I develop a web application (ASP.Net/VB and SQL) that is only accessible on their network to their employees? They plan to expand offices, could they set up a VPN to access the site?</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m leaning towards a web application, but I have not done too much in term of security. What specific options do I have for security that aren't too complex.   </p>

<p>Some of the problems he mentions are:</p>

<p><strong>- Exposed source code and File system browsing.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a web server must be able to read the source code in order to execute it. Since the web server is shared a PHP script written by another developer on the server can read arbitrary files. An attacker can also create a script that browses the file system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>- Exposed session data and Session injection.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By default, PHP stores session data in /tmp which is writable by all users, so Apache has permission to write session data there. A simple script can allow other users to read, add, modify, or delete sessions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ol>

<li>Why would one opt for shared hosting if it going to cause these huge security concerns?</li>
<li>I understand that shared hosting is cheap, but there must be a safer alternative to it and cheaper than dedicated hosting?</li>
<li>In case a customer ask me to develop an application that will be hosted on a shared hosting, is there a full proof way to develop a secure application or is it just a recipe for disaster? </li>

<li><strong>Access token</strong>, a long-lived token - issued by providing a valid phone token. Its task is to provide the identity of the phone owner. It carries the user's ID.</li>

<p><strong>My question is how to structure those two tokens correctly and whether I should use two distinct signing keys for them?</strong></p>

<p>From my understanding the subject (<code>sub</code>) of the phone token should be the phone number and the subject (<code>sub</code>) of the access token should be the user's ID. (<strong>Edit</strong>: I'm not even sure about that, how would the controller know how to interpret the number, i.e looking up the right resource? Wouldn't it be better to use strings like 'phone' and 'identity' for the subject and provide an additional 'id' field?)</p>

<p>What about the issuer field (<code>iss</code>), should this be something like <code>http://example.com/phone</code> and <code>http://example.com/identity</code> ?</p>

<p>What about the audience field (<code>aud</code>)? The phone token has a small audience, i.e only one or two services, should I specify them explictly? Like <code>aud: ['identity', 'xyz']</code>? </p>

<p>In case of of the access token the audience is quite broad, i.e many services which consume this token, and the audience might grow so I don't want to hardcode them into the token, otherwise I would have to issue new tokens everytime I add a service. How could I circumvent this?</p>

<ol>
<li>Carefully screening, filtering, encoding input (before insertion into SQL)</li>
<li>Using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement"">prepared statements</a> / parameterized queries</li>
</ol>

<p>I suppose that there are pros and cons for each, but why did #2 take off and become considered to be more or less the de facto way to prevent injection attacks? Is it just safer and less prone to error or were there other factors?</p>

<p>As I understand, if #1 is used properly and all caveats are taken care of, it can be just as effective as #2.</p>

<p><strong>Sanitizing, Filtering, and Encoding</strong>  </p>

<p>There was some confusion on my part between what <em>sanitizing</em>, <em>filtering</em>, and <em>encoding</em> meant. I'll say that for my purposes, all of the above can be considered for option 1. In this case I understand that sanitizing and filtering have the potential to <em>modify or discard</em> input data, while encoding <em>preserves data as-is</em>, but encodes it properly to avoid injection attacks. I believe that escaping data can be considered as a way of encoding it.</p>

<p><strong>Parameterized Queries vs Encoding Library</strong> </p>

<p>There are answers where concepts of <code>parameterized queries</code> and <code>encoding libraries</code> that are treated interchangeably.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I am under impression that they are different.</p>

<p>My understanding is that <code>encoding libraries</code>, no matter how good they are always have the <em>potential</em> to modify SQL ""Program"", because they are making changes to the SQL itself, before it is sent off to the RDBMS.</p>

<p><code>Parameterized queries</code> on the other hand, send the SQL program to the RDBMS, which then optimizes the query, defines the query execution plan, selects indexes that are to be used, etc., and then plug in the data, as the last step inside the RDBMS itself.</p>

<p>Encoding Library</p>

<pre><code>  data -&gt; (encoding library)
                  |
                  v
SQL -&gt; (SQL + encoded data) -&gt; RDBMS (execution plan defined) -&gt; execute statement
</code></pre>

<p>Parameterized Query</p>

<pre><code>                                               data
                                                 |

SQL -&gt; RDBMS (query execution plan defined) -&gt; data -&gt; execute statement
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Historal Significance</strong></p>

<p>Some answers mention that historically, parameterized queries (PQ) were created for performance reasons, and before injection attacks that targeted encoding issues became popular.  At some point it became apparent that PQ were also pretty effective against injection attacks.  To keep with the spirit of my question, why did PQ remain the method of choice and why did it flourish above most other methods when it comes to preventing SQL injection attacks?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Content Security Policy (CSP) provides security controls which can
  mitigate attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks
  based on introducing malicious or otherwise undesirable content into a
  web application. A CSP achieves this by specifying a whitelist of
  content sources for a web application that a compatible browser then
  enforces. A large variety of content can be controlled using a CSP
  including scripts, images and audio or video.</p>
  
  <p>By default, a CSP also implements other mitigations beyond
  whitelisting content sources. The main additional mitigations are:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Inline JavaScript will not execute: this mitigates the most common types of XSS attacks.</li>
  <li>JavaScript code will not be created from strings: this prevents attackers abusing JavaScript functionality to execute arbitrary
  JavaScript code.</li>

I'm pretty clear about how to do that from a technical point of view, but there is one massive potential security hole: I want the site to have users. </p>

<p>As anyone who has ever been a user knows, users forget usernames, forget passwords, sometimes forget that they even had an account with your site. Users respond to phishing emails and give away their credentials. If you do anything that they find too complicated they won't use your site, it has to be simple and all happen in as few clicks as possible, but we have to balance that out by making it as hard as possible for users to accidentally give away their credentials and to keep access to the service as secure as possible.</p>

<p>I've already posted <a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/q/33560/6605"">a question about keeping the ideas secret</a>, and received many great answers. Now, my concern is more about source code secrecy.</p>

<p>According to my observations of:</p>

<ul>
<li>The codebases I had to work on during my career,</li>
<li>My own willingness to keep some of my own source code secret, and:</li>
<li>A few articles like, for example, <a href=""http://tech.turbu-rpg.com/420/open-response-to-simon-stuart"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Open response to Simon Stuart</a> by the popular Programmers.SE contributor <a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/935/mason-wheeler"">Mason Wheeler</a>,</li>
</ul>

<p>I conclude that source code is kept secret mostly for those reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Because the author is ashamed of the code of such a bad quality, or the company fears losing reputation if somebody sees such bad codebase, or that given the low quality of the codebase, it will not bring anything useful to anybody to open source it: even if somebody would be interested, he would hardly be able to run the solution (or, often, even compile).</p></li>
<li><p>Because parts of the code are stolen (mostly from open source projects covered by a license which restricts its usage in a given situation),</p></li>
<li><p>Because the code relies on security by obscurity and the author doesn't care about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kerckhoffs's principle</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Because the product is so breakable that showing the code would cause too much harm: if a closed-source app with all those security leaks would withstand a newbie hacker, the same open sourced app would have far smaller chances, because even the beginner hacker would just have to study the code to discover all the holes.</p>

<p>If it's not clear what I'm talking about, here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>if (credentials.password === 'masterPassword12345')
{
    isLoggedIn = true
    currentUser = credentials.userName
}
else
{
    authenticate(credentials)
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Because the author over-estimated the source code (and his own skills and expertise). Example: believing that a home-made cryptography-related algorithm (which was never reviewed by anybody) is better than any well-known one.</p></li>
<li><p>Because the author believes that the idea behind the code is great, and that it would be stolen.</p></li>
<li><p>Because of the ""It's not perfect enough"" syndrome. In other words, the developer is willing to release the source code to public when the code is ""good enough"", but day after day, there are still things to improve, so the code would never be released.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>All of those reasons give a rather negative image of people who are against publishing the source code.</p>

<p>Are there valid cases to not release to the public the high-quality code which follows Kerckhoffs's principle?</p>

Recently we had a breach of out network and while this time no one managed to get anything it raised some security concerns. </p>

<p>It's a vast legacy system, replacing it right now is out of the question. It exists within our corporate network and users can't access this data storage directly due to specific AD and Network security policies. As practice shows those policies can be overridden because of our IT dept negligence. So what I want is to add an additional layer of security by encrypting everything within the storage.</p>

<p>The storage acts as an archive. People dump old documents into it and those documents are rarely if ever accessed. Placing all of the incoming files into some encrypted containers is not an issue, easy to implement. The question is - how do I store keys for those containers? If I'll put them inside of the general service database, anyone who'd like to access those documents in an unauthorized manner will be able to do so by simply gaining access to the database (SQL Server, used by many apps, possibly compromised due to badly designed legacy services in the company). </p>

<p>I can theoretically store keys in some other database (dedicated server with a proper setup of SQL Server\ PostgreSQL), physically disconnected from the main one and send keys from there only when requested and prevent attempts to dump all of the keys, any 'unusual' behavior is very easy to detect because people rarely request anything. And I don't care how long it'll take to restore and decrypt those containers, 1ms or 1 hour don't make any difference when taking in account the overall system processes. However, this approach feels a bit convoluted.</p>

<ul>
<li>User logs in,</li>
<li>User clicks export,</li>
<li>A file is generated,</li>
<li>User downloads the file.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm trying to figure out a way to secure the last step and limit access to the file. In order for the user to be able to download the file, it should be in a publicly accessible folder. That, however, means that the file is accesible to everyone else that has access to its full url.</p>
<p>I thought of a few possible solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Email the export file</p>
<p>Instead of having the user download the file, I could simply email it to their email (the one they used to register on the site). This seems like a decent option when the export files are small, but I don't think it'll be optimal for larger files.</p>
</li>
<li><p>.htaccess magic</p>
<p>I could automagically generate an .htaccess in the export dir that would only let the user who requested the export access it. Also a decent option, but it's webserver specific and IP based. I don't know if Apache will always be the webserver of choice for the project, and I'm not sure an IP based solution is actually secure.</p>

<li><p>Store the export file in a private folder and have the user fetch it through ftp</p>
<p>Secure, but not particularly user friendly.</p>

Until now I have been mainly been reading about common security culprits like SQL injection, XSS, etc. and trying to find these in the codebase.</p>

<p>During the review however I stumbled into something like:</p>

<pre><code>def user_id
  return (session[:user_id] ? session[:user_id] : NOT_LOGGED_IN)
end
</code></pre>

<p><code>NOT_LOGGED_IN</code> evaluates to <code>""WEBUSER""</code>. To me this seemed hazardous for various reasons so I started commenting the snippet:</p>

<pre><code># INSECURE: Although the function works fine it can be susceptive to 
#           misuse since under the hood it sets a username to a non-user.
</code></pre>

<p>And then I started thinking.. Is this actually something fitted in a <strong>security</strong> code review or the more common ""code review""?</p>

<p>I assume the main difference between the proper security issues like SQL injection and XSS is that they are very specific and thus objective. When it comes into naming of functions and variables, it involves what different people think and thus becomes subjective. Someone in this case might argue for example that <code>user</code> is anyone visiting the site - no matter if he is registered or not so in that case <code>WEBUSER</code> would be a valid guest id (but then again it is counter-intuitive that many such users would share the same id).</p>

<p>So how should someone approach the subjective versus objective issues battle?</p>

The application has a similar model as e.g. vCenter Server whereby a number of components store information in and extract information and workflows form a central database. The environment is managed from a console application which uses a windows service to connect to the database.</p>

<p>Due to security considerations SQL Authentication is not an option, but the application does support Windows Authentication. However when using windows authentication it passes the credentials of the user who is using the management console application on to the database in stead of using the service account under which the service runs.</p>

<p>This results in the situation where the security roles as they are defined within the application (AD users/groups mapped to certain permissions) requires these AD objects to also have a SQL Server login and certain permissions on the database (db-writer for certain tables, depending on the specific permissions in the app).</p>

<p>Apart from the additional administration, this also creates a security risk IMO because the whole point of the application security roles in this specific application is to allow users access to only a part of a certain table (e.g. a subset of the objects). But since they now have a SQL login and db_writer on that entire table they could bypass the app and with a direct connection to the database they could read/alter records they would not be allowed to view/manipulate through the application.</p>

<p>This risk could then (partly) be mitigated by restricting access to the database on a network level, or possibly use triggers to check the calling hostname and program name, but as far as I know that is not completely safe.</p>

<p>The only benefit as is presented to me is there is now a full audit trail available in SQL server on exactly who did what. But this is already implemented in the application as well so it seems kind of moot to me.</p>

<p>I have been frantically searching for any info on this and what would be the best practice. I can only find ASP / Web based stuff but nothing regarding this type of application.</p>

<p>Is it really the best way to go with passing through authentication to SQL server or should the app handle authorization and send all database requests using the service account?</p>

calls to the serial device. I think that it is a pretty neat idea, and I can use

<p>I had an initial interview/meeting yesterday with a potential employer and It seems like a great place to work... so I wake up today and start to do a bit more research on the company and try to find out how their website functions and what software and or framework's they're using. In the process of looking for something that will give me a little advantage in the next stage of interviews, I've found a big vulnerability in the system.</p>

<p>I can get access to the database, or a large part of it at least, which has some address, sort-code, banking provider type information in it judging by the table structure.</p>

<p>Now I'm a little stuck as to what I should do next... I'd have thought it would be a plus that I've found the vulnerability, and not someone with malicious intent, but will the company see it that way too?</p>

<p>It's a fairly large UK company and what I've accessed so far is still an Illegal activity I'd have thought.</p>

<p>Should I tell them as soon as i can, hint at there being a vulnerability but not say I've actually gained access, or do i need to get some kind of NDA sorted so i don't end up at the bad end of the deal?</p>

<p>Just to clarify, I know the database structures, and i know the databases aren't empty, so I'm fairly certain there will be confidential information there. I could access that data easily, but haven't.</p>

<p>The question I have now, is with applications that require to be up 24/7, what security concerns there are with a user that is logged in, vs the service not requiring a user to be logged into the machine.  Obviously, if a user walks away without locking, that's an issue (and with redundancy, that's more than one vector of attack), but what other concerns should I be looking at to help my team understand that we're better off using a service for stuff that needs to be up 24/7?</p>

"334156","1","","","2016-10-20 13:49:39","","4","1618","<p>we have started with microservices recently, but we have some problems with implementing the Security layer.</p>

<p>The idea is that the request comes to Gateway, the Gateway looks to authorization header, it validates user, create JWT token and then sends request with info about user to another microservice internally. The microservice is reachable only internally, therefore it trust the JWT token.</p>

<p>In last project, we put basic info about users into gateway - it was able to register, login, reset password etc.</p>

<p>But problem is, that the core microservices was handling users too - i.e. it had some fields to validate, which is not neccesary known for gateway. The registration process need first validate at the microservice and if it was ok, it was registered on both - the gateway (password, email) and microservice (phone number, name, ...)</p>

<p>Problem is when it fails on one of the microservice but the other one does not know about it. Then it is registered on i.e. gateway, but not on microservice. It basically means you have to care about ""transactions between microservices"", which is something you dont want to (stateless microservices are best to use).</p>

<p>Also some requests - especially registration - must be handled very specifically, which increase code-base and complexity of gateway.</p>

<hr>

<p>We are thinking about another solutions:</p>

<p>1)The users logic will be put into gateway - it is similar to current situation, but there will be no validation on core microservice, which makes it stateless. The core microservice will load new users lazily - when it opens JWT token and does not find it, it will create it.</p>

<p>2)We would have two microservices, one for registering and users itself, other for the other functionality, if authorization bearer is found, gateway would ask user service microservice for detail, if it is ok, it will pack info into JWT token and send next. Registration would be just passed into user service. Core microservice would be also lazily loaded.</p>

<p>3)We put user service functionality into core microservice itself, which would make ""more monolithic"" approach, but the core microservice is heavily dependent on users. (they register into groups, buy products etc.). The gateway would work similar as in case 2), it would ask core microservice about the user info and then pack JWT token and send it next.</p>

<hr>

<p>Also take in note that we are developing small or medium projects. The whole projects usually use 1000-4000 manhours from scratch to production, the backend itself takes 500-1500 manhours (we are developing mostly mobile apps including the servers they are communicating with).</p>

<p>The principle is simple: give companies a secure way of exposing data housed on premises and behind the firewall publicly.</p>

<p>This can include database data, as well as Legacy PC data through established connectors; SAP for example provides a connector for transacting with their legacy systems.</p>

<p>Early attempts were fixed providers for specific systems like SAP, IBM or Oracle, but the new breed is extensible, allowing Channel Partners and Consultants to build robust integration applications that can consume whatever data sources the client wants to expose.</p>

<p>I just happen to be close to finishing a Cloud Based HTML5 application platform that provides robust integration services, and I would like to break ground on an extensible data proxy to complete the system.</p>

<p>From what I can gather, I need to provide either an installable web service of some kind, or a Cloud service which the client can configure with VPN for interactions.</p>

<p>Then I can build in connectors, which can be activated with a service account, and expose those transactions via web services of some kind (JSON, SOAP, etc).</p>

<p>I can also provide a framework that allows people to build in their own connectors, and use some kind of schema to hook those connectors into the proxy.</p>

<p>The end result is some kind of public facing web service that could securely be consumed by applications to show data through HTML5 on any device.</p>

<p>My gut is, this isn't as hard as it sounds. Almost all of the 30+ companies (With more popping up almost weekly) have all come into existence in the last 18 months or so, which tells me either the root technology, or the skillset to create the technology is in abundance right now.</p>

Before the message is sent, the senders key pair would be re-generated on the fly based on their credentials (and maybe a password prompt) and used to encrypt the message.

The problem is that the customer is afraid of misuse of the published APIs by the 3rd parties to whom they don't trust completely (please, don't comment on this). A basic scenario is like this:</p>

<p>The public API contains an operation IsOurCustomer() that returns true/false if the person has a product in the bank. The subsequent operation is CreateNewCustomer(), and is called when IsOurCustomer() returns false.</p>

<p>The bank is afraid that a 3rd party could scan their customer-base by checking who is/isn't their customer via calling IsOurCustomer() sequentially for all people taken from another source (say from a public state registry).

<li><em>Throttling</em> - It's hard to set the right limit which wouldn't restrict the legal work of the 3rd party company, but would prevent them to misuse the API at the same time. Especially, when the 3rd party has many employees and enough time. The 3rd party could issue thousands of (justified) customer-checks per day, which could allow them to scan 1 million of people per year.</li>
<li><em>Legal threats</em> - when API misuse is detected (which needs logging, monitoring).</li>
<li><em>Payments per API call</em> - above an agreed limit</li>
<li><em>Heuristics</em> - e.g. signal an alert when the ratio of calls to IsOurCustomer() and CreateNewCustomer() is too high.</li>

<li>Our customer creates physical devices used in infrastructure across the globe</li>
<li>Their new devices have IoT capabilities and can communicate their status and other sensor data to the cloud</li>
<li>We are building a web portal that displays information about these devices</li>
<li>This web portal provides access to customers and to their staff</li>
</ul>

<p>The need:</p>

<p>We need to build a secure customer registration process that ensures the person who registers an account with the portal is their actual customer, and gains access to the data emitted from the device they own.</p>

<p>The current process, as outlined so far:</p>

<p>When a device is sold their ERP system will inform the customer portal, via a secure connection (API), that a device has been sold.  It will include device details (serial number, etc.) and some customer information (note: the customer information at this point may belong to a wholesaler and not be the end customer we are interested in).</p>

<p>The devices will include some kind of label with a QR code/URL/key that can be used to register the device.</p>

<p>The problem: it is difficult to make this secure, because, for example, it would be possible for someone to photograph the QR code while the device is in transit.  Someone with the photograph could then register the device inappropriately.</p>

<p>Ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a tamper-proof label, such as something that you can scratch the surface of (like a lottery ticket) to reveal a secret key used for registration.  Include a big warning that, if you are the end user and this label has been tampered with, you need to inform the company immediately.</li>
<li>Try to develop some kind of two-factor authentication, whereby on registration with the portal, the portal informs the ERP of registration, and the ERP sends an email to the customer to verify the registration.  Problem with this approach is the wholesaler situation I mentioned previously.</li>
<li>Request that the customer enter some kind of information that only they, and the origin company know, such as order ID.  Problem with this is that it's not terribly secure, the order ID may appear on bills of sale, shipping forms, etc.</li>

<ul>
<li>Create a session that expires after 30 minutes.</li>
<li>After 30 minutes, if there is no user activity in the application (including typing to a textbox, moving a mouse throughout the page), the session will be destroyed and the system will redirect itself to a logout page (logout.php). What I mean by keyboard/mouse is only specific to the system, if the system is open while I am doing other things outside of the system, the system should consider it idol.</li>
<li>If the session has moments left to live (E.G. 15 seconds) and there is user activity, the session's life would be extended to another 30 minutes. The reason for this is if a user is inputting a critical information, it would be highly inconvenient to log him/her out just before submitting the form. This is why keyboard and mouse movements should be detected by the system.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have come up with two possible solutions, but I am not satisfied with them.</p>

<h2>First solution</h2>

<p>I will almost use javascript for everything.</p>

<ul>
<li>Manage the session or cookie (I am not really sure if javascript recognizes server side sessions)</li>
<li>Detect keyboard/mouse activity</li>
<li>Extend the life of the session/cookie</li>
<li>Redirect to logout.php to destroy the session</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe this solution is extremely bad. I believe there are ways to manipulate javascript code to change it (to prevent the redirection to logout.php, for example). That is, I am doing a process that should be done in the server.</p>

<h2>Second solution</h2>

<ul>
<li>use javascript to detect keyboard/mouse activity as before.</li>
<li>15 seconds before 30 minutes, I will have to send an ajax request to a php page. The ajax request contains the information whether there is user activity during this time.</li>
<li>Now this particular php page manages the information sent by ajax. If user activity is detected, php just extends the session's life. Otherwise it has to redirect to logout.php either through ajax's .done function or through other means.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't think the processes I described above are good solutions. Specifically the heavy use of javascript to do server side things. My problem is I cannot find a way to detect keyboard/mouse movements using php. Everything I found regarding how to do this is by using javascript (understandably since user actions are done in the browser and not in the server).</p>

<p>How should I proceed? What would be the best and most secure solution?</p>

<p>While the world tends to use X.509 for authentication (especially in browsers), they are based on the principle of having a <em>central</em> authority vouch for each certificate, meaning the system would need a CA and anyone who wants to participate in the system would need to have their keys signed by that CA.</p>

<p>PGP, on the other hand, is based on a ""Web of Trust"", where parties who want to communicate merely need to have <em>any</em> trusted party in common who will sign both keys. A CA isn't necessary in this case.</p>

<p>My overall design goals prefer the Web-of-Trust model, to keep the system decentralized, but I may also have customers who prefer a centralized model, and I don't want to prohibit that possibility. Is there anything stopping the Web-of-Trust principle from working with X.509? Likewise, is it easy and straightforward to mimic CAs in the PGP cryptosystem?

Of course I've run into the same-origin policy, and now I'm wondering how web servers (rather than web browsers) enforce it. From what I understand, some enforcing seems to happen in the browser's end (e.g., honoring an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header received from a server). But what about the server?</p>

<p>For example, let's say a web server is hosting a Javascript web app that accesses an API, also hosted on that server. I assume that the server would enforce the same-origin policy --- so that only the javascript that is hosted on that server would be allowed to access the API. This would prevent someone else from writing a javascript client for that API and hosting it on another site, right? So how would a web server be able to stop a malicious client that would try to make AJAX requests to its API endpoints while claiming to be running javascript that originated from that same web server? What's the way most popular servers (Apache, nginx) protect against this kind of attack? Or is my understanding of this somehow off the mark?</p>

<p>Or is the cross-origin policy only enforced on the client end?</p>

What I want to do, is make sure that the client connecting to the server is actually using my protocol and I can ""trust"" the data being sent from the client to the server. </p>

<p>What I thought about doing is creating a sort of hash on the client's machine that follows a particular algorithm. What I did in a previous version was took their IP address, the client version, and a few other attributes of the client and sent it as a calculated hash to the server, who then took their IP, and the version of the protocol the client claimed to be using, and calculated that number to see if they matched. This works ok until you get clients that connect from within a router environment where their internal IP is different from their external IP. My fix for this was to pass the client's internal IP used to calculate this hash with the authentication protocol. My fear is this approach is not secure enough. Since I'm passing the data used to create the ""auth hash"".</p>

<p>Here's an example of what I'm talking about:</p>

<pre><code>Client IP: 192.168.1.10, Version: 2.4.5.2
hash = 2*4*5*1 * (1+9+2) * (1+6+8) * (1) * (1+0)
Client Connects to Server
client sends: auth hash ip version
Server calculates that info, and accepts or denies the hash.
</code></pre>

<p>Before I go and come up with another algorithm to prove a client can provide data a server (or use this existing algorithm), I was wondering if there are any existing, proven, and secure systems out there for generating a hash that both sides can generate with general knowledge. The server won't know about the client until the very first connection is established.</p>

<p>The protocol's intent is to manage a network of clients who will be contributing data to the server periodically. </p>

<p>New clients will be added simply by connecting the client to the server and ""registering"" with the server. So a client connects to the server for the first time, and registers their info (mac address or some other kind of unique computer identifier), then when they connect again, the server will recognize that client as a previous person and associate them with their data in the database.</p>

<p>Edit:
The approach I ended up going was this:</p>

<p>I ended up using an approach similar to what OpenSSH does, but reverse. Since when a client connects, I'm not sure I can trust the client.</p>

<p>If it is the first time a client is connecting, it will provide me with a public key and a unique identifier (In this case, I will be using a computer's service tag since the computers I'm going to be dealing with are all Dells). The server stores the id and public key in the database then sends the client a secret question encrypted using the public key. The client will then need to respond with the decrypted answer. Before a client can be accepted by the server, I may end up doing a unique id registration on the server manually before connecting the client for the first time, this way not any sly person can just generate public keys and emulate what a client does with a ""new unique id"". </p>

<p>Thanks for the help! I hope this helps someone down the line. Feel free to tear apart the security flaws of this approach :)</p>

The Application has multiple customers so separation of their data (logically, the data is stored in the same DB) is a must have of the system. Each request will be checked for validity no matter what.</p>

<p>On the client side you would do:</p>

<pre><code>my_hmac = hmac(my_secret, my_values)
</code></pre>

<p>Where you would have a <code>timestamp</code> field in <code>my_values</code>.  </p>

<p>On the server (where you also know <code>my_secret</code>) you would attempt to rebuild the HMACd string with the request parameters:</p>

<pre><code>my_hmac_to_compare = hmac(my_secret, my_values_from_http_request)
</code></pre>

<p>Is it simply a case of embedding the timestamp as a parameter so it's hashed in to the HMAC string and then ensuring the timestamp is within N minutes of when we process the request?</p>

<p>I have odd visions of having to iterate over 5 minutes worth of timestamps, rebuilding the HMAC string on the server attempting to find the needle-in-the-haystack that will generate the correct HMAC string.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus question:</strong> Is there a consensus on how you would initially transfer the secret key to a client from a server?  It obviously becomes ""dirty"" after it goes over the wire, but in a user facing application you can't have someone pasting in an extensive secret key, especially if it's a mobile client.</p>

<p>I currently use Play 2.2 framework, with a mechanism that store the data about logged in user in the Play cache (temporary persistent so).</p>

<p>When the user wants to authenticate, it calls a dedicated API that grabs its credentials and if valid, server generates a cookie that will be sent to him. This cookie contains a reference id of the user's data in the Play's cache.</p>

<p>Then, each time a user calls an API requiring user authentication, server grabs the user cookie (if any), asks for the cache and checks in there whether user is well already authenticated regarding the validation duration. </p>

<p>Here a little sample:</p>

<pre><code>def myApi = userAuthenticatorRequest.securedAction {    //user has to be already logged in
    implicit request =&gt;
      //do something
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Should I leave from this solution in order to be compliant with best practices, or should I keep it?
Is it really considered as a stateful mechanism?
If I understand, this is stateful since a call to a secured API required actually two calls:</p>

<ul>
<li>authentication api</li>
<li>secured api</li>
</ul>

<p>while a stateless would authenticate user directly in the secured api, and thus would be totally independent of any context. Of course, user would have to sent each time its credentials (or API key)</p>

I have three tables: <code>users</code>,<code>question</code> and <code>answers</code>, each table has it's own primary key and <code>questions</code> and <code>answers</code> both have foreign key constraints. <code>questions</code> store <code>users.uID</code> to look up author, and <code>answers</code> store <code>question.qID</code>to identify which question they belong to, and also author that wrote the answer, so <code>users.uID</code> is also foreign key.</p>

<p>And here is my main concern: how to properly implement submit button for answer, that passes the author ID and also question ID that is supposed to be inserted in <code>answers</code> table via ajax request, so it has to get that ID from somewhere. The main concern is not XSRF, but the fact that authorised user could tamper with it, by changing a part of html code if the ID is stored visibly (or invisibly) somewhere.</p>

<p>User ID is easy, that can be stored in session once retrieved from DB and user logs in and will be reused elsewhere too so no big deal in term of performance costs, and can be accessed by all scripts while hidden from user. But also storing the question ID in session, each time user visits a question, and then replacing that with another question ID when he visits another question seems to me like it is asking for causing heavy load on server at some point. </p>

<p>Adding hash to the submit button, that is then validated by script that processes the ajax call data looks cumbersome to me too, since you have to store that hash in session too. And using hidden field is not safe either, since user can see that field in source code and can tamper with it.</p>

<p>So where to efficiently store that question ID, so it is ready when the submit button is pressed and also that user cannot tamper with it, and send ajax call with other ID? Is the session really only option?</p>

They will have a contact list where people can be added.
One of the security measures(others are in place, too) is to have a local ID assigned to a contact.</p>

<p>To make the process clear, imagine the following scenario:</p>

<p>$UserA prompts $UserB to be added to $UserA's contact list.
$UserB accepts and $UserA receives a local ID to use as UserID referring to the contact.
The database contains a table called USER_MAP(LocalID,UserID).</p>

<p>Two questions:</p>

<p>1) Do you think this is a valid approach when dealing with user ids security? If not, why?
2) If you deem it valid, can you suggest a formula to generate said IDs?</p>

<p>At the moment, the idea for the formula is: 
($UserA_ID+$UserB_ID)*($UserA_RegDate+$UserB_RegDate)</p>

<p>Consider RegDates as being in ""number of days since the 0 date value"".</p>

<p>Each user might have 1..N local ids depending on how many users are willing to add.
A local ID is local to the user but global in the user space, i.e. for every interaction between users the same local id is used.
To make it clearer: if $UserA requests to see $UserB profile, he will be passing the local user id which will be mapped at the server level to the correct id.</p>

<p>Just to make it clear: future does not mean ""in a long time from now, maybe, who knows"", rather means : ""it is planned, I want to do it, I want to make sure I have my pieces ready and THEN I will do it"" :) Thus, it's not a ""maybe"" rather just a matter of WHEN.</p>

<p>Apparently someone has issues understanding the logic behind the approach of a local id.
A couple ideas that can help you understand why it's a good idea(in my opinion):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If your ID is local instead of global, you have <em>only</em> access to your own resources/contacts. Useful for instance to avoid programmatically getting access to a profile you wouldn't be allowed to see. This with third parties <em>may</em> be a problem, especially in case of unfair uses</p></li>
<li><p>If your ID is local, you can use it as a shortcut for local data instead of having to go to the original account. The contact list could, for instance, hold some of the original data which isn't going to change.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a local id it's much easier to ""cut the wire"", because all you have to do is deleting one or two records. Say that a user wants to delete a contact. All I will have to do is to remove <em>at best</em> two records, all the other data stays there untouched and
simply filtered out by the queries.</p></li>

<p>The problem is to be able to store and retrieve passwords as safely as possible for the users of the system.</p>

<p>One user (a company with several employees) may have a number of clients for whom they have access to report, say taxes or VAT using different services. That requires credentials for those services. And it requires that those credentials are stored as safely as at all possible.</p>

<p>Users could do this themselves in password managers, but there is a big risk that either they mess up by not synchronizing changes between employees or they forget to delete credentials when a client is no longer with them.</p>

<p>Further there may be levels of access usually meaning several password manager storage files. Which will increase the mess the user's employees can get themselves into.</p>

<p>I can think of the following requirements</p>

<ul>
<li>Passwords are encrypted with public/private key pair</li>
<li>Passwords are stored in the database as encrypted</li>
<li>Passwords are never shown in clear text, only copied to clipboard and expires in short time</li>
<li>Only employees having access to correct private key can decrypt</li>
<li>When client is deleted all passwords for that client are deleted</li>
<li>public/private key pair is not stored in database, security handled by access to client machines</li>

Leave Roles as ""priviledge"" holder and hardcode them. Then I can code to those roles inside app using all available markups/attributes, etc - all Microsoft.</p>

<p>Now, creating a simple record of financial transactions is theoretically easy. One database table with a few columns could do the job. Even MS Access, Excel, or even just a plain ASCII text file could be used to store transaction dates, account IDs, and dollar amounts. However, I feel that even a frequently backed-up SQL table with transactional integrity might not be robust enough for serious financial tracking.</p>

<p>I hear terms like ""double-entry accounting"", and I get the feeling that most financial tracking apps (for example, Mint.com, or GnuCash) have a much more complicated data structure or process in place to make double-sure that everything adds up perfectly, exactly as it should, and that no data is ever lost or corrupted.</p>

<p>My question is: <b>When designing an app to track financial transactions, what special design considerations should be made?</b> It seems like there could be so many potential issues... issues with rounding precision, parity checks, some kind of audit process, special backups, security/encryption, extra ways to protect data in the case of a crash mid data-entry....

Even though the server operator may request a certificate on its behalf, when server operator and domain owner distrust each other, domain owner wins.</p>

<p>SSL and TLS are usually associated with the domain name, and the client doesn't care about server's real IP. However the client always asks the server for a certificate. This results in one more RTT, making HTTPS one time slower than HTTP, not taking into account the key exchange which add 1 to 2 RTTs. Keep-Alive header and TLS 1.3 makes the problem less of a headache, but the RTT at first handshake cannot be saved. Why not just let the DNS server return the server IP together with the certificate and key exchange information, saving one RTT?</p>

<p>The only advantage I see here is that multiple servers can use multiple certificates. This allows to revoke one of the certificates without affecting the others. However, if any of these servers is compromised, it doesn't make detecting compromise any easier. With any private key MITM attacks can already be quite transparent, and it's just as difficult to notice the attack.</p>

<ol>
<li>Redirect to Facebook, user is authenticated, returneded from Facebook to the app - email, name, facebook ID etc is provided from FB .. but ofcourse, no password</li>
<li>We look in our system for any existing user by the email address. If a user is found, then that is the currently logged in user; otherwise, create a new user with the user info returned from FB.</li>
</ol>

<p>Email kinda makes sense as we don't want duplicate email addresses (also the database currently won't allow it due to unique index) so if a user has signed up already with that email address, it won't attempt to create a new user for them. Instead it will pull the previously registered user.</p>

<p>Is this the sound approach though? Exploring all possibilities, I was wondering what happens in the event that the user tries to register by our conventional registration form, but as they have already created an account with that email from their initial Facebook login, we wouldn't allow the duplicate email. So having made the decision to use their Facebook to login, they are stuck with that method. Is this a common/ok approach? </p>

<p>Also without intention, if they use the conventional registration form first, and setup their account that way, we have their password, so they could login using our form or login with FB and the user account will just be pulled by email. However, if they choose to login with FB first time, and their account is created that way (we won't obtain the pw), they must always use FB only. I've absolutely no idea whether this could be problematic or not, I kinda want to go with the option of - whatever means you chose to login/register first time round - then that's what you stick with :)</p>

<p>I'm a little new to having users sign up with multiple logins so heads a bit full of ""what ifs"" etc. Would appreciate any advise on this, and common approaches. Thanks</p>

<p>Alternatively, we loose the index on the email field, add a field somewhere to store the facebook ID, and at the application level decide whether to permit duplicate email address and more distinction between users of different login methods (therefor allowing a user to have a conventionally registered user account, and/or a seperate facebook login auth/created user account, both with the same email address - but different methods of login - least if the user deletes their Facebook account, they can create an account with their email through our register form)</p>

<p>I am working on the UI of our inventory system when I found out that when registering a user in the system, the username and password of the user <em>is optional</em>. I asked our supervisor why is this so. He said that in the system, there are &quot;bins of assets&quot; (think of boxes with toys) where we assign through the system employees to handle these bins. Employees must be registered in the system but some of them are not given access to the system, therefore <em>there is no use giving them usernames and passwords</em>.</p>
<p>But I think his argument is wrong, really wrong because every time I hear &quot;no username no password&quot; makes me cringe as it is most synonymous to a no-password, free-to-access account.</p>
<p>And so I ask:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>What would be the correct database design to separate this system-user employee and non-system-user employee that does not use this no username, no password scheme?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, as the description implies, we have a single table with uid, username, hashed password and other fields with additional user data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To prove to him a point, I would like to know <strong>why storing a blank username and password for an account is totally wrong for non-system-user registered employee</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What are alternatives to having this system?</strong> I know it's best to keep in one table the registered users but I have never seen this situation where there are registered users that don't have access to a system. It's like you are given a Facebook account, profiles and all but don't have a username and password for it (or in this case, blank)</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>

<p>The company I work for is dedicated to creating apps for other companies. Because of this we have many different clients and handle many different projects within our company's Github Enterprise organization.
I'm one of the people in charge of the company's Medium blog. Since we would like to promote the company by showing the kind of people that work here, I consider it essential to be able to post articles using each of our personal accounts. In my opinion, being able to share sample code greatly increases the value of an article. And being able to do it with our own personal Github accounts would also serve as a motivator for people to contribute to the blog. (Especially those who have many personal projects on their personal Github accounts)</p>

<p><strong>Current Situation:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>All engineers at our workplace have Github Enterprise accounts. These accounts allow us to pull and push from the repositories within our organization. Only admins are allowed to create new repositories though.</p></li>
<li><p>Our GHE accounts connect through SSH.</p></li>
<li><p>We are currently not allowed to use personal Github accounts within our work computers, but allowing them is being taken into consideration.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Issue:</strong></p>

<p>Managers are afraid that if personal Github accounts are allowed on company machines, employees might end up pushing our clients' code to their personal repositories BY MISTAKE, making it a huge risk of unintentional information leak. </p>

<p>Allow me to clarify here that, it is not an issue of policies or trust. </p>

<p><strong>The Question:</strong></p>

<p>Considering the following hypothetical actions taken by an employee:</p>

<li>Modifies some code or adds some features to the project (but forgets push the changes)</li>

"158245","1","158253","","2012-07-25 23:43:41","","9","1876","<p>I'm in the design process for a Java web app that I will probably end up deploying to Google App Engine (GAE). The nice thing about GAE is that I really don't have to worry about fortifying my app from the dreaded DDoS attack - I just specify a ""billing ceiling"", and if my traffic peaks up to this ceiling (DDoS or otherwise), GAE will just shut my app down. In other words, GAE will essentially scale to any amount until you simply can't afford to keep the app running any longer.</p>

<p>So I'm trying to plan a contingency whereby, if I do hit this billing ceiling and GAE shuts my app down, my web app domain DNS settings ""fail over"" to another, non-GAE IP address. Some initial research has shown that certain CDNs like CloudFlare offer services for this exact situation. Basically, I just keep my DNS settings with them, and they provide an API I can hit to automate a failover procedure. Thus, if I detect that I'm at 99% my billing ceiling for my GAE app, I can hit this CloudFlare API, and CloudFlare will dynamically change my DNS settings to point away from the GAE servers to some other IP address.</p>

<p>My initial contingency would be to failover to a ""read-only"" (static content only) version of my web app hosted somewhere else, maybe by GoDaddy or Rackspace.</p>

<p>But then it suddenly dawned on me: <strong>if DDoS attacks target the domain name, what difference does it make if I rollover from my GAE IP address to my (say) GoDaddy IP address?</strong> In essence, the failover wouldn't do anything other than allows the DDoS attackers to bring down my backup/GoDaddy site!</p>

<p>In other words, DDoS attackers coordinate an attack on my web app, hosted by GAE, at <code>www.blah-whatever.com</code>, which is really an IP address of <em>100.2.3.4</em>. They cause my traffic to spike to 98% my billing ceiling, and my custom monitor triggers a CloudFlare failover from <em>100.2.3.4</em> to <em>105.2.3.4</em>. The DDoS attackers don't care! They're still launching an attack against <code>www.blah-whatever.com</code>! The DDoS attack continues!</p>

<p>So I ask: what protection do CDNs like CloudFlare offer so that - when you need to fail over to another DNS - you aren't at risk for the same, continued DDoS attack? If such protection exists, are there any technical restrictions (e.g. read-only, etc.) that are placed on the failover site? If not, what good are they?! Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Obviously, a developer does need to think about security while coding &mdash; SQL injection, password security, etc.</p>

<p>However, as far as the real, fully-formed security, especially the tricky problems that may not be immediately obvious, should I be concerned with tackling these throughout the development process, or should it be a step of its own in later development?</p>

<p>I was listening to a podcast on <a href=""http://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Security Now</a> and they mentioned about how a lot of the of the security problems found in Flash were because when Flash was first developed it wasn't built with security in mind (because it didn't need to) &mdash; therefore Flash has major security flaws at its core.</p>

Are there DBMS's that provide an alternative interface (say an API) to the usual query language text prompt, that's less flexible and less powerful for simple operations?  Ideally any task that involved user input would be handled with a combination of simple queries via this API and logic in the programming language.  SQL or another query language would be reserved for either human users or particular nearly-static queries that did not incorporate user input.</p>

<p>Architecturally the lack of a text stream would probably remove simple network transparency, requiring a local ""server"" acting as dispatch to the real server on the network.</p>

<p>As I said I'm currently a beginner at any of this, but this seems such an obvious design decision that I suspect it either already exists (maybe everywhere), or it is actually impossible in practice.  It would be nice to know why.</p>

<p>Added later:
To clarify the intent is to access the database without using reflection somewhere.  Ideally all possible locations of reflection of user input would be ruled out including any use of the system shell.  SQL is just the starting point, but under this logic Shellshock is considered the same type of vulnerability as SQL injection.</p>

<p>I created a prototype of this using <code>Flask WTF</code> forms. The basic implementation is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>User lands on messaging page and chooses recipient</li>
<li>Javascript detects which recipient the user has chosen</li>
<li>User sends message via form</li>
<li>Form is handled by endpoint</li>
<li>Message is stored on the backend's database</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some limitations and considerations I can think of:</p>

<ul>
<li>this system is not ""live"", i.e.: users have to refresh page to see new messages</li>
<li>users can't see if the other user is typing (not a massive deal breaker in my use case)</li>
<li>figuring out the recipient with JS could have security violations (?)</li>
<li>a massive influx of messages can bring down the whole backend since the messaging system is not decoupled from it</li>
<li>notifying users of a new message / marking message as read will have to be done via JS which again could have security implications (?)</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, I am mostly worried about using JS to handle some of this, as I am not very familiar with how to do it in such a way that it can't be maliciously manipulated (e.g.: users attempting to access messages not intended for them / sending messages to users they are not allowed to, etc.)</p>

<p>The other concern is that the system is not decoupled.</p>

<p>After building this prototype, I actually began considering paying for a service like Twilio to handle this part of the website, but I would like to see if I can build it myself.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Implement a DSL (domain-specific language)</strong>:
This would be ideal, but adding branching and looping logic to a DSL seems more like creating a new programming language.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>STDIO pipe</strong>: Simply allow the execution of a program in a sandbox on a server. This is most flexible, but the gods of software security would not be merciful. Docker I guess?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pure sandboxed ruby code</strong>: Create a sandbox that allows only functionally pure Ruby code to be executed in it. Then simply evaluate the function inside the sandbox whenever required. This would be a security flaw as well, but not half as much as options 2. For now this option seems to be implementable using <a href=""https://github.com/vaharoni/trusted-sandbox"" rel=""noreferrer"">trusted-sandbox</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/quix/pure"" rel=""noreferrer"">pure</a>.</p></li>

<p>I would like to make the admin panel completely inaccessible to the public. If I were the only developer, I would probably opt for developing two applications mostly bound by the same database. My reasoning is based mostly on the principle of least privilege - if there is no need to make something public, then why would I? Also, this does not mean that I intend to implement weak customer security. I only believe that if I can get some extra safety for this specific scenario, then why not?</p>

<p>However, my colleague, who's doing the UI, is settled on creating a single app with a single login page for all users. I guess it is not really important, and I am not keen of arguments. And yet I still would like to apply the aforementioned principle to make it somewhat impossible to login as an administrator from the public.</p>

<p>I was thinking:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have a main domain <strong>mystore.com</strong> and a subdomain <strong>admin.mystore.com</strong> both pointing to the same backend.</li>
<li>Only allow access to the subdomain via a VPN connection (I guess I would perform the necessary checks in the backend application code).</li>
<li>If the login request is coming from the admin subdomain, I would match the credentials agains the admins table. Otherwise I would check the customers table.</li>
</ol>

<p>In my eyes, an administrator is not a customer, and since they don't really share any details aside from the login credentials and full name, I would keep these two separate.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Overall, does my reasoning make any sense, how bad is this idea and am I just wasting my time?</li>
<li>If it's feasible, is only allowing access to a subdomian via a VPN possible? Sadly I don't know much about setting VPNs up either.</li>
<li>If not feasible, what would be your advice? Would you have one site, one login page, one common table and exactly the same level of security for both the admins and customers?</li>

<p>I probably didn't make my limitation very clear.</p>

<p>Let's say that I already have a working UI single-page app, which I won't be able to modify for a number of reasons.</p>

<p>This UI code has a login page, which calls a login endpoint somewhere, which then returns a token. Based on this token the page redirects the user to either the admin or the customer dashboard.</p>

<p>The administrator resources in the back-end are, of course, protected by user roles, so it's not a <em>huge</em> problem. Yet still, in addition to that I want to limit the possibility of logging in as an admin from the public Internet as much as possible.</p>

<p>I have complete freedom over the server and no control over the UI. I was thinking about separating admins and customers into different tables and routing the login request to match against the respective table based on how the endpoint is being accessed. If I can't achieve what I want this way, then <em>it seems</em> like any other change would require an accompanying UI change.</p>

<p>The problem is that before I can make some waves regarding it, I need to suggest a better solution. This far, I suggested that we e-mail it to each other (since that requires at the very least login to Exchange, something that needs to be provided at each synchronization).</p>

<p>We're sitting on SharePoint, Windows 7/8, Exchange Server and use windows authentication via AD when accessing our computers.</p>

<p>Often, we're working at the office (65%) or at home (25%) but some portion is done in a coffee shop or such (10%). The information to be stored is just a text file (or a set of text files) and needs not necessarily to be compartmentalized inside our organization (we trust all the employees). The information needs to be centrally available (as it can change on occasion) but there's no need to encrypt it.</p>

In other words: on-premise servers instead of a cloud-based solution. </p>

<p>My company wants to be able to authorize only some third-parties to be able to create apps that can use our APIs, but not just anybody, in addition to our own apps. So we will likely have some process where third parties will submit their apps to us for signing and adding to some kind of 'white-list' (whatever form that ends up taking.. hence the question.)</p>

<p>(Why no cloud? Some countries and industries are subject to stricter regulations where cloud or off-site servers is not an option for some classes of sensitive operational data. If that is not good enough of a reason, then please consider this a thought experiment). </p>

<p>This question is a variation on <a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/219028/how-to-safeguard-a-rest-api-for-only-trusted-mobile-applications"">this near identical question</a>, but with the additional constraint that the software vendor doesn't own or manage the servers.</p>

<p>I have zero affiliation with CodeBlue, the makers of Approov, but they did publish a decent explanation of the typical process for securing REST APIs for both web apps and mobile apps. Here is a link to part 2 of 3 which covers some of the critical points such as the mediation server and the attestation process for authorizing the client and techniques for keeping shared secrets out of public clients (i.e.: mobile apps).</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.approov.io/blog/mobile-api-security-techniques-part-2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.approov.io/blog/mobile-api-security-techniques-part-2.html</a></p>

<p>The solution described by the above article from CodeBlue sounds dandy for a cloud-based or vendor-controlled environment. However, I have been struggling to find a way to protect against clone apps when the customer has physical access to not only the clients, but to the servers. Configuration alone could probably enable unauthorized apps, and if that doesn't work the app itself could be modified.</p>

<p>Of course there is a legal safety net here (license agreement, terms of service), but is there anything code-wise that can be done to harden against this, if not prevent it outright?</p>

<p>I am aware of - and pursuing - various techniques for obfuscating solutions (like spreading the secrets around, and protecting against reverse engineering) and for client attestation, but in all of my models so far there exists the possibility that a malicious customer (or agent) can trick the REST API into believing that requests are made by an authorized client. I know I'm in some kind of arms race here - so I'm reaching out to the community for thoughts on this because all of the methods I have researched over the past week rely on the vendor owning the server.</p>

<p>The client is entirely headless, and can connect to any instance of the backend installed on a server (supply the URL).</p>

<p>Over time, we can expect the backend to grow and branch into new API versions. We cannot assume the client will maintain parity with the backend, so the client may connect to an instance of the backend with an API version that it cannot support.</p>

<p>The client needs to know the API version of the connected backend so it can take action/adjust its functionality accordingly.</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>How can the client securely know the API version of the backend?</strong></p>

<p>The glaringly obvious answer is: <em>The backend advertises its API version in a header.</em></p>

<p>This, however, is uncomfortable for a variety of reasons --- as a rule, advertising software versions to all and sundry <a href=""https://www.troyhunt.com/shhh-dont-let-your-response-headers/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">is a bad idea</a>.</p>

<p>Only the client application needs to know the API version.</p>

<p>One approach is to implement an API key system, where the backend can issue keys which should be supplied by the client to unlock sensitive API endpoints.</p>

<p>However, the scenario I'm working with is user-facing – one instance of the client, supporting many API versions, may be used to connect to many instances of the backend.</p>

<p>The specific scenario is a headless CMS, with a management app that needs to support remote installs of the backend with an initially unknown API version. The login screen currently has fields for server URL, username and password, and adding a fourth for ""API Key"" becomes a bit cumbersome.</p>

<p>So is there another approach I've failed to hit upon yet? The API Key seems to be the most feasible so far, but I don't necessarily want end users to supply keys upon login.</p>

<p>Now suppose that parent is a library, as a HTML5 application in a browser this cannot do much harm because is practically running sandboxed, but now with the advent of the ChromeOS, FirefoxOS and other [Browser] OS they will also be linked to a native API, that would be a head out of the „sandbox”. Now if someone changes the namespace it would be harder for a code reviewer (either automated or not ) to spot an incorrect use if the namespaces changes.</p>

<p>My question would be: Are there many ways in which the above situation can be done and what can be done to protect this namespaces? (Either in the javascript itself or by some static code analysis tool)</p>

In order to do the process RESTfully, I understand that I'll need to use some kind of token-based authentication to avoid tracking client session data on the server. The following quote from <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/81756/session-authentication-vs-token-authentication"">this answer</a> on the Information Security Stack Exchange nicely sums up my understanding of the implementation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Token-based Authentication no session is persisted server-side (stateless). The initial steps are the same. Credentials are exchanged against a token which is then attached to every subsequent request (It can also be stored in a cookie). However for the purpose of decreasing memory usage, easy scale-ability and total flexibility a string with all the necessary information is issued (the token) which is checked after each request made by the client to the server.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this, I understand how stateless session maintenance is advantageous for scalability, and flexibility as explained. But it seems to me that this leaves the application exposed to some serious problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>If a hacker somehow intercepts the credential exchange HTTP REST call, they could execute <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">replay attacks</a> on the server get all the information they want.</li>
<li>In fact, since the session token is stored on the client side, couldn't a hacker just retrieve the requisite information from LocalStorage/SessionStorage by debugging the app? Or by monitoring the incoming and outgoing HTTP calls using dev tools? If they get the required token information (even encrypted token information), they could simply start faking REST calls to the server from another window and get all the data they want!</li>
</ol>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fr629.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fr629.png"" alt=""Replay Attack Wikipedia image""></a></p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Finally, even if you do give the client a session token, wouldn't the server still have to authenticate <em>that</em> token? In effect, the server would have to maintain session tokens to user mappings...but doesn't that defeat the purpose of a stateless REST-based architecture?</li>
</ol>

<p>Maybe I am seeing these problems because there is a gap in my understanding. If that's the case, I'd like some clarity of the basic concepts. If not, I'd like to know if there are any techniques to address these specific problems.</p>

<p>In the panel, you can edit the individual row and save it to the database through an ajax request based on the data-post-id.

<p>Context: An intranet web application that our customers use for accounting and other ERP stuff.</p>
<p>I'm of the opinion that an error message presented to the user (when things crash) should include as much information as possible, including the stack trace. Of course, it has to start with a nice &quot;An Error has occurred, please submit the below information to the developers&quot; in large, friendly letters.</p>
<p>My reasoning is that a screenshot of the crashed application will often be the only easily available source of information. Sure, you can try to get a hold of the client's systems administrator(s), attempt to explain where your log files are etc., but that will probably be slow and painful (talking to the client representatives mostly is).</p>
<p>Also, having an immediate and full information is extremely useful in development where you don't have to go hunting through the log files to find what you need on every exception. But that could be solved with a configuration switch.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there has been some kind of &quot;Security audit&quot; (no idea how they did that without the sources), and they complained about the full exception messages citing them as a security threat. Naturally, the clients (at least one that I know of) has taken this at face value and now demands that the messages be cleaned.</p>
<p>I fail to see how a potential attacker could use a stack trace to figure anything out he couldn't have figured out before. Are there any examples, any documented proof of anyone ever doing that? I think that we should fight this foolish idea, but perhaps I'm the fool here, so...</p>

I dont like the language be it TSQL or PL/SQL; they seem archaic against Java/Dot-Net which I use. I go for them when a routine needs to fetch a lot of data, crunch it and generate a small set of output. Sitting inside the DB makes the fetching process a lot fast, no network hit. But that is all.</p>

<p>I recently came across a DAL design where absolutely all of the CURD operations were implemented in Stored Procedures. Actually one giant sProc to be precise. Here is the skeleton:</p>

<pre><code>PROCEDURE myGenericProc(int QueryNo, varchar genericParam1, ..., varchar genericParamN)
BEGIN
    SWITCH queryNo
    CASE 1
        SELECT * FROM table1 INNER JOIN table 2 ON ...

    CASE 2
        DELETE FROM table 3 WHERE ...
    ...

    CASE n
        UPDATE table4 SET a=b WHERE ...
END
</code></pre>

<p>The designer's logic behind this is: if I do these things in code, then the database-connection needs to have full rights on all the tables. The connection credentials are generally in connection string, which is on the application server. If the application server is compromised, inevitably the entire DB is also compromised.</p>

<p>As an alternative, have all the queries in the sProc, then grant that sProc full rights. Call only that sProc. This way, even if the application server is compromised, only the sProc interface can be attacked. No one can do <code>DROP users_master</code>. </p>

<p>While I agree with the principle, I hate the implementation. Unfortunately, some security paranoid clients (banks) want us to do exactly that. Also, the DBAs hate tuning access privileges on 200+ sProcs, they want as-few-as-possible items to audit.</p>

<p>In general, aren't we just moving the problem? For example, with Azure KeyVault, the app ID and app secret become the things that you need to keep out of source control. Here's an unfortunately <a href=""https://github.com/rahulpnath/Blog/blob/master/AzureKeyVault/AzureKeyVault/Program.cs"" rel=""noreferrer"">typical example</a> of how this tends to go wrong. Other approaches end up being similar, with API keys or keystore files that you have to protect.</p>

<p>Is there a way to manage secrets that doesn't just move the problem? I believe this question has a single clearly defined answer. By analogy, if I were to ask how HTTPS doesn't just move the problem, the answer would be that CA keys are distributed with your OS, and we trust them because we trust the distribution method of the OS.

<p>The is all good and well, but with all these methods, i'm just storing a salt or hash value somewhere instead of the key itself, in the end.

<p>One option I've read about that seems the most secure is to not store this value in the desktop app at all, but to call a web service to obtain the key (probably encrypted).

<p>The next best alternative seems to be obscurity.</p>

"164916","1","","","2012-09-14 17:03:54","","6","181","<p>There are cases where you have the opportunity, as a developer, to enforce stricter security features and protections on a software, though they could very well be managed at an environmental level (ie, the operating system would take care of it).</p>

<p>Where would you say you draw the line, and what elements do you factor in your decision?</p>

<h2>Concrete Examples</h2>

<h3>User Management is the OS's responsibility</h3>

<p>Not exactly meant as a security feature, but in a similar case Google Chrome used to not allow separate profiles. The invoked reason (though it now supports multiple profiles for a same OS user) used to be that user management was the operating system's responsibility.</p>

<h3>Disabling Web-Form Fields</h3>

<p>A recurrent request I see addressed online is to have auto-completion be disabled on form fields. Auto-completion didn't exist in old browsers, and was a welcome feature at the time it was introduced for people who needed to fill in forms often. But it also brought in some security concerns, and so some browsers started to implement, on top of the (obviously needed) setting in their own preference/customization panel, an <code>autocomplete</code> attribute for <code>form</code> or <code>input</code> fields. And this has now been introduced into the upcoming HTML5 standard. For browsers that do not listen to this attribute, strange hacks<sup>*</sup> are offered, like generating unique IDs and names for fields to avoid them from being suggested in future forms (which comes with another herd of issues, like polluting your local auto-fill cache and not preventing a password from being stored in it, but instead probably duplicating its occurences).</p>

<p>In this particular case, and others, I'd argue that this is a <strong>user setting</strong> and that it's the <strong>user's desire</strong> and the <strong>user's responsibility</strong> to enable or disable auto-fill (by disabling the feature altogether). And if it is based on an internal policy and security requirement in a corporate environment, then substitute the user for the administrator in the above.</p>

<p>I assume it could be counter-argued that the user may want to access non-critical applications (or sites) with this handy feature enabled, and critical applications with this feature disabled. But then I'd think that's what security zones are for (in some browsers), or the sign that you need a more secure (and dedicated) environment / account to use these applications.</p>

<p><sup>* I obviously don't deny the ingeniosity of the people who were <strong>forced</strong> to find workarounds, just the necessity of said workarounds.</sup></p>

<hr>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>That was a tad long-winded, so I guess my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Would you in general consider it to be the application's (hence, the developer's) responsiblity?</li>
<li>Where do you draw the line, if not in the ""general"" case?</li>

<p>So I have this web application that I have started to write in backbone using a Single Page Architecture (SPA) however I am starting to second guess myself because of security.  Now we are not storing and sending credit card information or anything like that through this web application but we are storing sensitive information that people are uploading to us and will have the ability to re-download too.</p>

<p>The obviously security concern that I have with JavaScript is that you can't trust anything that comes from JavaScript however in a Backbone SPA application, everything is being sent through JavaScript. There are two security features that I will have to build in JavaScript; permissions and authentication.</p>

<p>The authentication piece is just me override the Backbone.Router.prototype.navigate method to check the fragment it is trying to load and if the JavaScript application.session.loggedIn is not set to true (and they are not viewing a none authenticated page), they are redirected to the login page automatically.  The user could easily modify application.session.loggedIn to equal true (or modify Backbone.Router.prototype.navigate method) but then they would also have to not so easily dynamically embedded a link into the page (or modify a current one) that has the proper classes, data-* attributes, and href values to then load a page that should only be loaded when they user has logged in (and has the permissions).</p>

<p>So I have an acl object that deals with the permissions stuff.  All someone would have to do to view pages or parts of pages they should not be able to is to call acl.addPermission(resource, permission) with the proper permissions or modify the acl.hasPermission() to always return true and then navigate away and then back to the page.</p>

<p>Now certain things is EMCAScript 5 like Object.seal() or Object.freeze() would help with some of this however we have to support IE 8 which does not support those pieces of functionality.</p>

<p>Now the REST API also performs security checks on every request so technically even if they are able to see parts of the interface that they should not be able to, they still should not be able to actually affect any data.</p>

<p>The main benefits for me in developing a JavaScript SPA application is that the application is a lot more responsive since it is only transferring the minimum amount of JSON data for the requested action and performing the minimum amount of work too.  There are also other things that I think are beneficial like you are going to have to develop an API for the data (which is good if you want expand your application to different platforms/technologies) or their is more of a separation between front-end and back-end however if security is a concern, it is really wise to go down the road of a JavaScript SPA application for the front-end?</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Great answers. My question arises from this question from quora regarding source code protection: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/How-does-Facebook-protect-their-source-code"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/How-does-Facebook-protect-their-source-code</a></p>

<p>Here's the pertinent answer that got me thinking:</p>

<p><code>
Facebook (and Google and probably many others) don't have employees check out code on their laptops. Code is checked out on developer servers or workstations and employees connect to these to work. These are only accessible on the corporate network, and connecting  from outside the network requires VPN, which itself requires multi-factor authentication.
</code></p>

<p>Now that I think about this, if developer have terminal access to the development servers then they must have access to mostly whatever is in there which most likely includes the db. </p>

<ol>
<li>the security api which authenticates/authorizes, issues/revokes token with user roles/permissions and accounts. It would have a separate db</li>
<li>the business API that has the business functionality, accessible only thru the token issued by the security api. It would have a separate db</li>
<li>notification api that sends real time notifications and email or text alerts. Again a separate db. </li>

<p>On the front there would be separate apps: 
one for security api for managing roles user accounts, monitor logs etc
and another one, the business app, for the complex business functionality.</p>

<h3>The Situation</h3>
<p>I am creating an interface to allow end users to insert and update data in a table stored in an Oracle database. The interface will ask for an Excel worksheet and then generate a MERGE script with SQL to insert the data into the database table. I want the users to have to log into the database before they can perform these types of transactions.</p>
<p>I can think of a few ways to accomplish this:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Ask my DBA to create a new schema in the database, store this table there, and give all end users permission to edit tables in this schema.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ask my DBA to create a new schema (aka &quot;user&quot; in the case of Oracle) and have end users all use this one userId and password. So maybe the userID is named &quot;Accounting&quot; and the password is &quot;hunter2&quot; and everyone in Accounting is given this user ID and password. Then I store the table in the &quot;Accounting&quot; schema.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Number 1 seems like a better option than number 2, but I'm not confident that either of these are good ideas.</p>

That time our internal discussions didn't end up anywhere and the whole issue was forgotten for the time being.</p>

<p>Now we've touched upon it again, this time with username/password credentials for external systems. So, a more generic/slightly different version of the same question:</p>

<p>When your system interfaces with multiple 3rd party external systems, there are some sort of endpoint configurations involved. Typically there will be a URL and either a username/password combo, an API key, or a client certificate. More often than not there will even be two sets of these - one for a testing/development environment, another for production.</p>

<p>So, after these have been communicated, what is the best practice what to do with them?</p>

<ul>
<li>My opinion is that they should be documented somewhere. If you want them to be secure, you can encrypt then somehow (KeePass, ZIP file with a password, whatever). But there should be a logical place where they should be kept against future need. Perhaps it can be in the project documentation. Perhaps there's a central storage for these. Whatever. Just - somewhere else where people can quickly find them when needed.</li>
<li>My colleague's opinion is that they should NOT be documented anywhere. Well, OK, the test credentials can be documented, but the production credentials should only exist in a config file on the production server(s) and nowhere else. His reasoning is that nobody should need to access these credentials outside that server and storing them elsewhere compromises security. If the production server suffers a crash - that's what backups are for and those backups include the config files too. And if the whole system is so broken that even the backups are corrupted - then you have a bigger problem anyway.</li>

I'm looking for a way to delegate authentication of devices to which ever organisation a device belongs to.  This doesn't affect authorisation models, only authentication.</p>

<p>So to put this in terms of DNS domains:</p>

<ul>
<li>organisation <code>foomy.tld</code> should be able to authenticate (eg: sign the certificate for?) <code>new_deive.foomy.tld</code>.</li>
<li>organisation <code>acme.tld</code> could choose to trust <code>foomy.tld</code>:

<ul>
<li>It should then be able to trust <code>new_device.foomy.tld</code> is what it says it is on the authority of <code>foomy.tld</code></li>
<li>BUT organisation <code>acme.tld</code> should NEVER trust <code>foomy.tld</code> to authenticate any device outside the domain of <code>foomy.tld</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Considering using x509 and SSL</h3>

<p>In the case of x509 CA certificates, the CA role is usually performed by a third party CA.  But that isn't appropriate for this purpose:</p>

<ul>
<li>The creation / destruction of device IDs (services) is too rapid to consider a traditional CA (too expensive, too slow).</li>
<li>This mechanism needs to authenticate clients and servers.  Devices / services do not always have public IP addresses so CA solutions such as LetsEncrypt aren't an option.  </li>
<li>Creating a dedicated CA for this single purpose is not cost effective and likely to damage adoption.</li>
</ul>

<p>So this leads to the idea of an organisation acting as their own CA for this purpose.  But as it turns out, x509 really doesn't support this well, because once you accept a CA as being trustworthy you cannot limit the scope of that trust enough.  IE: <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/31376/can-i-restrict-a-certification-authority-to-signing-certain-domains-only"">You cannot trust it to only sign certificates for it's own domain</a>.</p>

<h3>Considering re-purposing single sign on mechanisms</h3>

<p>The single sign-on mechanisms I've looked at appear to be built around the concept of authenticating users.  Background automated services don't appear to be well supported.</p>

<p>Maybe I missed something here.</p>

<h3>Question - Keeping it as narrow as possible.</h3>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> - a (randomized) password is split in half and is stored across two separate servers, to foil hackers that gained access to either server upon a security breach.</p>

<p>Now the main question is, how would this kind of system would be made... <em>codespeaking</em>, for PHP which I commonly develop on my web applications, the database password is normally stored in a configuration file, i.e. config.php with the username and password, in that case it is understandable that the passwords can be stolen if the security was compromised.</p>

<p>However when splitting and sending the other half to the other server, how would this go on when making a communication to the other server (keeping in mind with PHP) since the other server password would be stored in a configuration file, wouldn't it? In terms of security is to keep the other server password away from the main one, just exactly how would the main server communicate, without exposing any other password, apart from the first server.</p>

<p>This certainly makes me think...</p>

<p>I am writing a small independent service which will expose a basic REST API enabling client applications to upload and download files. Please don't ask why I'm not using S3 or some other cloud provider service - suffice to say that the decision is out of my hands! </p>

<p>The service will just lump files into a flat storage space and leave it up to the client applications to structure the information if required. The service will therefore handle 'clients' with many 'files'.</p>

<p>Initially, this service will only be used by an old monolithic legacy web app - a classic 3 tier client-server architecture using J2EE and Apache Wicket for the front end (so server generated UI). There are dedicated instances of this web application running within third-party data centres as well as a few instances running in our own data centre. All of these will access the new service so not all communication will be within the same data center (all over HTTPS though).</p>

<p>Some instances of the legacy web-app are multi-tenant so within one such instance, not all tenants will have access to the new service. </p>

<p>At some point, there will also be a dedicated administration interface (in order to create new clients and assign storage quotas etc.) which will be a JS-SPA and will call admin REST endpoints.</p>

<p>So I'm having trouble figuring out which OAuth flow to implement. Implicit Flow seems appropriate for the JS Administration interface but as for the legacy app (and any future services/applications) I'm not really sure.</p>

My program compiles the scripts using a third-party library, sandboxes them using the .NET Code Access Security mechanisms and makes sure that they have only those permissions that the user wants to give them.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, my security requirements are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the user should be able to restrict the untrusted script's access to only certain parts of the filesystem, including forbidding all filesystem access</li>
<li>the user should be able to restrict the untrusted script's network connections to only certain IP addresses or hostnames, including forbidding all network connections</li>
<li>it is okay if the user script manages to hang or terminate the host application, but the user script must not be able to circumvent the permission restrictions (i.e. denial of service is okay, breach isn't)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm contemplating trying to do something similar in C++, as a sort of a personal exercise. Obviously, things are more complicated when running native code directly, even if the user scripts are written in a scripting language like Lua.</p>

<p>The first approach I can think of is to insert my own hooks in the scripting environments standard library functions. For example, if the scripting language is Lua, instead of exposing io.open normally, I would have to expose a wrapper that checked the arguments against the script's permissions before passing them to the original implementation.</p>

<p>My concern with this approach is that it drastically increases the amount of my own code that is in charge of security and, therefore, a potential security vulnerability that I wrote myself. In other words, when working with .NET CAS, I can trust that Microsoft did its job well in the sandboxing code, as opposed to having to trust my own sandboxing code.</p>

<p>Are there any alternatives I'm unaware of?</p>

<p>I have a Web API 2 project, without any extension of ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET projects. The API will only be used to communicate between the server and Windows 8, Windows Phone 8.1 and iOS applications. No website will consume the API. The API makes it possible for a user to manage products in a warehouse. A user can add, remove, and check products ín the database. </p>

<pre><code>public class User
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    [Required]
    public string UserName { get; set; }
    [Required]
    public string DisplayName{ get; set; }
    [Required]
    public bool IsEnabled {get; set;}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing fancy - just a model for Entitiy Framework. Of course a model for the product also exists. Notice, I don't require any password from my users, since this is not important for the data security. The users of the API will never know each others UserName - only each others DisplayName.</p>

<h1>The problems</h1>

<p>The problem is regarding security in Web API. I do not want to expose my API to the whole world - just the applications. So i have done a lot research, and from the research I have the following to scenario:</p>

<h2>Scenario #1</h2>

<p>The best way to ensure a high level of security in my API is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use SSL</li>
<li>Use token-based authentication of the clients</li>
<li>use a token with a very short expiration time</li>
<li>not to use the ASP.NET Identity</li>
<li>to use Message Handlers instead of Action Filters</li>
<li>Add a UserToken field to User model and generate a token for each user</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scenario #2</h2>

<p>The best way to ensure a high level of security in my API is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>use SSL</li>
<li>use ASP.NET Identity to do username and password approach</li>
<li>use a token-based approach based on the authentication of ASP.NET Identity</li>
</ul>

<h1>The Questions</h1>

<ul>
<li>What is the best approach? Scenario #1 or #2?</li>
<li>In general, what is the best way to secure an API? </li>
<li>Is the best way one of my scenarios?</li>
</ul>

<p>Please feel free to add/remove items from the two scenarios, but also to add new and more secure scenarios.  </p>

<p>Usually when dealing with user-input text, it is recommended to 'escape-on-output' instead of 'escape-on-input'. There are numerous examples (<a href=""http://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/why-escape-on-input-is-a-bad-idea/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a>, <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/9415/filter-user-input-before-the-database-or-upon-display"">2</a>, <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/42498/which-is-the-best-way-to-sanitize-user-input-in-php"">3</a>) as to why this is better, but it basically boils down to: you need to sanitize the text depending on the context in which it is used. If inserting a user chat message into a database, you should escape for SQL and use prepared statements. If display the chat message to a web browser, you should escape for HTML. Etc.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, none of the above security concerns were recognized until recently. (Yes, really).</p>

<p>The quick 'hack' solution was to filter user chat messages when received by the server, and <em>strip out any possibly nefarious-looking character</em> (&lt;,>,"",',{,},\, etc). This led to a lot of user complaints, since their punctuation would now magically disappear when displaying in the chat channel.</p>

<p>I want to believe that we can do better than this current 'hack', and allow users to type any text they want in a secure environment.</p>

<p>The problem is that I am working with seemingly impossible constraints. We have numerous versions of the client, spread over many devices, thousands of users, and slow adoption rate of new versions. There's lots of fragmentation, and we can't force clients to update.</p>

The Access Token and Refresh Token are stored on the server side. Periodically, the Refresh Token is used to get new Access Tokens to keep the user logged into the site. I believe this is a security risk because -</p>

<p>Imagine if a user is logged onto his OP account in a browser. He opens up Sky and is directly logged into MP because he’s already logged into MP. He then in a separate tab, logs out of his OP account. He will continue to be logged into MP for days on the basis of this Refresh Token/Access Token mechanism! Isn’t this a security risk?</p>

<p>If feel like the correct way to go about this is to use Session Management using iframes as prescribed here on OIDC - <a href=""https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html</a></p>

<p>For more context, when a user logs into our WebApp we pull data from the OP's UserInfo endpoint to create a profile within our WebApp and set permissions/roles within our app based on data sent over from the OP's UserInfo endpoint. We continue doing this periodically. For this purpose, I feel like using the Access Token(and using the Refresh Token to get new Access Token) to access the UserInfo API is correct because it conforms to the OAuth 2.0 concept of protecting/authorizing API/Resource endpoints using Access Tokens.</p>

<p>I want to know if this is indeed the correct way to manage how a user should be logged in when supporting Open ID Connect.</p>

In the future, we also plan on developing more of these websites in the future.</p>

<p>The website includes the following several registration steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>One of the steps gathers customer details, including what we need to
provide the benefit (e.g. Address or IBAN number).</li>
<li>One of the steps gathers a proof of purchase, often in the form of a product code or receipt.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each of these steps, validation is done to ensure that the data is legitimate input before continuing. At the end of the registration, there is a 'register now' kind of button to officially register.</p>

<p>I want to split the implementation between an API and a frontend.
Now I want to make sure that the customer doesn't bypass registration steps in the frontend (that include validation) and calls the final API call by itself to get the benefit without having bought the product.</p>

<p>I imagine this may be doable with some kind of session, or by keeping all data around and re-submit it in the final request and then validating it again in the backend. However, I am unsure which would be better, and if there is some option that I am missing which would be better than both.</p>

<p>For this question I want to focus on the web design aspect, so defending against forged purchase proofs is out of scope of this question.</p>

<p>I don't think my current method of achieving this is the greatest and I'd like to scrap it and start over fresh. Here's how it works:</p>

<ol>
<li>The app picks a string from a set that I'll call the ""entropy"".</li>
<li>Using that string it makes a hash of the current UTC date using the entropy as the salt</li>
<li>It sends that hash to the API server which then creates the hash using every possible entropy from the set until it finds a match</li>
<li>If it finds a match, a API key is generated for the app and sent back.</li>
</ol>

<p>The server stores the entropy string, the API key, as well as the <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIDevice_Class/#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UIDevice/identifierForVendor"" rel=""nofollow"">IDFV</a> in a database. </p>

<p>When the app makes a request, it sends their API key, the IDFV, and a bearer token. The bearer token is a hash of the URL with the entropy string as the salt.</p>

<p>When the server recieves a request it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Selects the entropy string from the database using the API Key and the IDFV as search parameters.</li>
<li>Generate it's own bearer using the URL it's responding to, and the entryopy from the above select.</li>
<li>Verify that the entropy strings match</li>
</ol>

<p>If the select query returns nothing, or if the bearers don't match the server will return a 403 and not proceed.</p>

<p>The problems I'm worried about are:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the user has an incorrect date on their device the registration will fail.  Likewise,</li>
<li>If the server has an incorrect date the registration will fail</li>
<li>If the app starts registration at 23:59:59 and there's a 1s delay time to the server (which over 3G is totally plausible), the registration will fail</li>
<li>With a hard-coded list of entropy strings can the app be decompiled and the strings extracted</li>
<li>With only a limited number of entropy strings it's possible to find all of them with enough time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the things I have took into consideration:</p>

<ul>
<li>All requests and responses are served over HTTPS</li>
<li>The API server rate-limits requests to hamper brute force attempts</li>
<li>The API server is behind CloudFlare to also do some basic attack prevention.</li>
</ul>

<p>What I want to know is what would be a better way of going about this that doesn't require any extra user interaction?  The iOS app is built using Objective-C and the API server is built using Ruby.</p>

<p>As per <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24053587/how-to-check-string-pool-contents"">this question</a> Strings in StringPool are not available directly.
To obtain Strings in Stringpool, we would need a password-dictionary to check them in StringPool. If we have a password-dictionary, we don't need to worry about StringPool, we can anyhow try directly on password fields.</p>

<p>To prevent <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Brute-force attack</a>  we are limiting number of re-tries for passwords and checking for any suspicious activities.</p>

<p>If all that is in place still should we not use ""String"" as a datatype for passwords?</p>

<p>The answer obtained from similar questions is: We can have access to memory dump and get access to Strings in stringpool.</p>

<ul>
<li>A Client is requesting a resource from a Host multiple times, usually with minutes or hours between requests.  </li>
<li>The Client has a signed, verifiable token, which we'll call a <strong>Receipt</strong>, that asserts that they should be allowed to access the resource. (The Receipt will eventually expire, say at the end of the month.)</li>
<li>The Host has no way of knowing (and <em>should</em> have no way of knowing) who the Client is beyond the fact that a given receipt is being reused.</li>
<li>EDIT: The Receipts come from a third party, the Notary. The Notary <em>does</em> have a meaningful idea of who a user is (in the sense that they can charge them money), but <em>does not</em> know which user owns which receipts. (Receipts are validated using a <a href=""https://github.com/ShapeOfMatter/RSA-Blind-Signature"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blind signature scheme</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Problem:</h2>

<p>Receipts cost money. (We're building a micro-transaction service; so they cost ~0.10USD) We don't want users (Clients) posting their Receipts online for public use, or otherwise sharing Receipts.<br>
(<strong>EDIT: The goal isn't to prevent anyone from ever sharing a Receipt; individual Receipts just aren't worth that much. The goal is to prevent (or make sure we can combat) anyone making a <em>system</em> for sharing Receipts on a large scale.</strong>)</p>

<p>Note that in this model a ""user"" may have multiple ""Clients"" running on different machines, and will share Receipts among <em>their</em> Clients.<br>
<sub>(EDIT: How they do this isn't set-in-stone yet; suppose there's a SaaS party offering encrypted private cloud storage, similar to a password manager.)</sub></p>

<h2>Proposed Solutions:</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Have the Client create a public/private key pair</strong> for each receipt (or however often the Client wants to). The public key will be submitted with the Receipt, and whenever the Host sees a given Receipt for the first time they'll store the accompanying public key so they can verify that future submissions came from the same person (even though they don't know who that is).  

<ul>
<li><strong>cons:</strong> This just moves the ""secret that shouldn't be shared"" from the Receipt to the private key.</li>
<li><strong>pros:</strong> A private key really is easier to keep secret, in particular because, while the Receipt is sent to the Host, the private key never leaves the Client's control.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Have the Host give the Client a single-use Token</strong> (as part of their normal response) to be included with their next submission of a given Receipt. These Tokens can be quite small. Re-submission of a Receipt (even once) without the expected Token is <em>evidence</em> that the receipt has been shared.

<ul>
<li><strong>cons:</strong> This will make both systems (Client and Host) harder to implement. It's convoluted and error-prone. Because Clients owned by a single user <em>will</em> share Receipts, some ""false positives"" are inevitable. Furthermore, sharing Receipts <em>inappropriately</em> is still possible using a system not too different from how well-behaving users will share Receipts among their devices. In this sense this solution relies on incompetent members of they hypothetical sharing pool accidentally violating the Token chain.</li>
<li><strong>pros:</strong> Building a sharing pool would be relatively <em>difficult</em>, and as a pool scaled up in members and usage it would become increasingly non-performant (because of locking) or increasingly likely to break Receipts (because they'd been noticed as shared). Additionally, a ""good samaritan"" in the sharing pool would be able to break the shared Receipts by <em>intentionally</em> violating the Token chains.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Give ""good samaritans"" a specific function for invalidating receipts</strong>. 

<ul>
<li><strong>cons:</strong> Does nothing to directly prevent sharing, it relies entirely on the idea that any hypothetical sharing pool would either <em>not scale</em>, or <em>eventually</em> be infiltrated by some kind of defector. </li>
<li><strong>pros:</strong> It's much easier to implement. Additionally, if <em>combined</em> with #1, then the Host would have a signed invalidation request they could present if their decision to reject subsequent submissions of that Receipt were ever challenged. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>EDIT: Rate-limit per-Receipt submissions</strong>. For example specify that receipts can't be used more than five times in an hour, or 10 times in the Receipt's lifetime. Thank-you <a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/319783/kain0-0"">@Kain0_0</a> for the suggestion.

<ul>
<li><strong>cons:</strong> Does nothing to directly <em>prevent</em> sharing. May limit usage of otherwise compliant users (for better or worse).</li>
<li><strong>pros:</strong> Places a hard limit on <em>how much</em> a given receipt could be shared in practice. </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Originally I was planing on doing #1 and #2</strong>,<br>
but having thought about it for a couple days I'm thinking #1 and #3 (or <em>maybe</em> just #3) would be easier and <em>good enough</em>.</p>

<p>This signature has to be stored (in the database) and used (if required) to verify that message was not changed while processing.</p>

<li>client sends object and signature to the service</li>
<li>service calculate hash from object properties and verify signature</li>

<p>The question is how to define and share hash calculation logic between service and client? Please note that client can be implemented using different framework or programming language.</p>

<p>I've thought that dto can have <code>string GetHashData()</code> method that will concatenate valuable dto properties to the string. Then hash can be calculated for this and is used to sign or to check the signature.</p>

<p>However having method in the dto object does not look good. </p>

<p>I can implement some helper class and use it in the rest service that to calculate hash for each object type. But this logic has to be implemented on the client side as well. It can make usage of the service a little bit tricky.</p>

<p>I know that both xml and json has digital signature, like XMLDSIG and JWS. But it makes digital signature to be dependent from the format that was used by the client to talk with service. I can not use JWS or XMLDSIG if object was deserialized and passed as parameter to the REST controller.</p>

<p>I'm writing a common set of tools for PHP and most of my inspiration has come from the .NET framework.  The ironic thing is that I have never used the .NET framework, but I do understand C# and can therefore port the concepts I ""do"" understand from Mono.</p>

<p>But I have run into a bit of a wall, <code>System.Security</code>.  As I browse over the API docs, and the Mono security implementations on Github, I quickly feel like none of features could ever be applied to PHP.  My current confusion is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>PermissionSet ps1 = new PermissionSet(PermissionState.None);
ps1.AddPermission(new FileDialogPermission(FileDialogPermissionAccess.Open));
Console.WriteLine(ps1.ToXml().ToString());
</code></pre>

<p>So here is a basic example.  What I want to do in PHP is create an application partially governed by permissions on the ""environment"" level.  That is to say, one machine shouldn't be able to perform certain actions that another might.  For instance, machine A, shouldn't be allowed to TCP to machine B.</p>

<p>But when I look at the code in the example, I don't really understand why it makes any difference.  My current understanding is that this is not ""setting"" the permissions, but ""checking"" them.  And the permission itself is predefined somewhere else, I.E. in the machine.</p>

<p>I have looked over Java's implementation of the same feature, and side by side .NET looks a lot more in-depth.  I would like to incorporate this concept into my own PHP code, but right now I don't know how I would do it.  </p>

<p>Are the permissions entirely arbitary? does .NET ""impose"" restrictions? or simply provide security diagnostics to the application?  If the last one is true, then porting to PHP is not only possible, but may actually be quite useful.  However I know that in PHP, the second one is impossible.</p>

<p>Could someone please clear up what the Java and .NET security namespaces do, and give me an idea of how feasible it is to port to other languages.</p>

<p>I choose this model because it's easy to implement on both sides.

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
Once the user has signed in, an 'identity' for them is maintained in the system, to which all content they create is associated. A user can associate one account from each of the supported providers with this identity.</p>

<p>I'm concerned about how to protect potential users from connecting the wrong account to their identity in our application.</p>

<p><strong>/Edit</strong></p>

<p>There are two main scenarios that could happen:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>User has multiple accounts on one of the three providers, and is not logged into the one s/he desires.</p></li>
<li><p>User comes to a public or shared computer, in which the previous user left themselves logged into one of the three providers.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>While I haven't encountered many examples of this myself, I'm considering requiring users to password authenticate with Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn whenever they are signing into our application.</p>

<p>Is that a reasonable approach, or are there reasons why many other sites and applications don't challenge users to provide a user name and password when authorizing applications to access their social media accounts?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>A clarification, I'm not intending to store anyone's user name and password. Rather, when a user clicks the button to sign in, with Facebook as an example, I'm considering showing an ""Is this you?"" type window.</p>

<p>The idea is that a user would respond to the challenge by either signing into Facebook on the account fetched from the oauth hash, or would sign into the correct account and the oauth callback would run with the new oauth hash data.</p>

<p>App is the main application, where all users are registered and do some activity. RecordApp is a utility application where App users can store records that publicly visible in the App (like sub-twitter). RecordApp knows nothing about users, but each record (""tweet"") needs to have an author. I need to provide ability to use the RecordApp from the frontend and don't use the App like a proxy. I have some options to do this:  </p>

<p>The first is: User passes authentication on the App server and receives JWT token (that was signed using App public key) that tells that the user has name ""User1"" and can create public records. Then user sends this to RecordApp, it validates it (using RecordApp secret key) and sees that this user can create a record and then creates it. But if some hacker steals the User cookie, then the hacker can post malicious records by the name of ""User1"". I could solve this by setting httpOnly flag for the cookie, but App and RecordApp have different domains, so that wouldn't work.<br>
What do I do to secure such microservice?</p>

<p>The second option is as user passes authentication on the App server, send to the user a public_key that will be used to sign jwt with the record contents. If the hacker will be able to steal it from the-middle, then they just can post this message unchanged. But what do I do to protect the public key then?</p>

<p>I'm fundamentally not understanding the necessity for the two request/response cycles between client app and authorization server, where:</p>

<ul>
<li>First the user is redirected to the auth server during an <strong>Authorization Request</strong>, whereby (on successful authentication), they receive an <strong>auth code</strong>; and then</li>
<li>Next, the client app makes a second <strong>Token Request</strong> to the auth server, whereby the auth server validates the client's ID, secret and auth code, and sends back an <strong>access token</strong> for it to use</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Auth codes vs. access tokens</h3>

<p>What is the difference between this ""auth code"" and this ""access token""? Why do I need to first generate an auth code so that I can, subsequently, obtain an access token?!? <strong>Why not just do all this in 1 roundtrip and get an access token upon successful authentication?</strong></p>

<h3>Access tokens and resource servers</h3>

<p>I assume that the main point of the access token is to act as a hall pass for future requests, so that client apps aren't re-authenticating each subsequent request. Ergo I assume that, with a valid access token, client apps can now ""speak directly"" with resource servers. And I assume that, upon receiving each request, the resource servers probably validate access tokens with their respective auth servers. <strong>Am I on track here or way off base?</strong></p>

<h3>Access tokens and SSO?</h3>

<p><strong>Can access tokens be used in an SSO scenario where you have multiple resource servers all using the same auth server?</strong> Meaning, once I authenticate with an auth server and receive my access token from it when I'm inside 1 SSO app, can I then migrate to another SSO app, and apply the same access token (assuming it hasn't expired yet) and be ""signed in"" to that second app, without having to re-authenticate?</p>

<ul>
<li>Each client has a unique public/private key pair</li>
<li>Only the client and the server know the private key; it is never sent over the wire</li>
<li>With each request, the client takes several inputs (the entire request itself, the current timestamp, and the private key) and runs them through an HMAC function to produce a hash of the request</li>
<li>The client then sends the normal request (which contains the public key) and the hash to the server</li>
<li>The server looks up the client's private key (based on the provided public key) and does some timestamp check (that admittedly I don't understand) that verifies the request is not a victim of a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack"">replay attack</a></li>
<li>If all is well, then the server uses the private key and the same HMAC function to generate its own hash of the request</li>
<li>The server then compares both hashes (the one sent by the client as well as the one it generated); if they match, the request is authenticated and allowed to proceed</li>
</ul>

<p>I then stumbled across <a href=""http://jwt.io"">JWT</a>, which sounds very similar. However the first article does not mention JWT at all, and so I am wondering if JWT is different than the above auth solution, and if so, how.</p>

<p>So, let's say I'm going to build a Stack Exchange clone and I decide to use something like CouchDB as my backend store. If I use their built-in authentication and database-level authorization, is there any reason not to allow the client-side Javascript to write directly to the publicly available CouchDB server? Since this is basically a CRUD application and the business logic consists of ""Only the author can edit their post"" I don't see much of a need to have a layer between the client-side stuff and the database. I would simply use validation on the CouchDB side to make sure someone isn't putting in garbage data and make sure that permissions are set properly so that users can only read their own _user data. The rendering would be done client-side by something like AngularJS. In essence you could just have a CouchDB server and a bunch of ""static"" pages and you're good to go. You wouldn't need any kind of server-side processing, just something that could serve up the HTML pages.</p>

<p>Opening my database up to the world seems wrong, but in this scenario I can't think of why as long as permissions are set properly. It goes against my instinct as a web developer, but I can't think of a good reason. So, why is this a bad idea?</p>

<p>EDIT: Looks like there is a similar discussion here: <a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/86461/writing-web-server-less-applications"">Writing Web &quot;server less&quot; applications</a></p>

<p>EDIT: Awesome discussion so far, and I appreciate everyone's feedback! I feel like I should add a few generic assumptions instead of calling out CouchDB and AngularJS specifically. So let's assume that:</p>

<ul>
<li>The database can authenticate users directly from its hidden store</li>
<li>All database communication would happen over SSL</li>
<li>Data validation <em>can</em> (but maybe shouldn't?) be handled by the database</li>
<li>The only authorization we care about other than admin functions is someone only being allowed to edit their own post</li>
<li>We're perfectly fine with everyone being able to read all data (EXCEPT user records which may contain password hashes)</li>
<li>Administrative functions would be restricted by database authorization</li>
<li>No one can add themselves to an administrator role</li>
<li>The database is relatively easy to scale</li>
<li>There is little to no true business logic; this is a basic CRUD app</li>

<p>We use the user's identity to apply access control at the entity layer. The user's identity is communicated between services by attaching security tokens to the service invocations (SAML/JWT).</p>

<p>One of our customers wants to use an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture"" rel=""nofollow"">Event Driven Architecture</a> to build a product on our platform instead of the more traditional request/response pattern.

<p>FOR EXAMPLE:</p>

<p>Suppose the user creates a new task in the front-end web application. Instead of calling the Task service (sending along the user's identity) and waiting for the response, the application stores the task creation event in the queue and delegates the actual creation of the task to a background worker subscribed to this type of message. </p>

<p>However, in order to determine if the user who initiated the task creation is allowed to create a task, the task service (a background worker) needs to call the entity layer in the context of the user. </p>

<p>I could store the security token together with the task creation payload, but given the temporal decoupling of the producer and consumer, this token may have expired by the time it is used to call into the entity layer.</p>

<p>Are there any well-established patterns to solve this problem? I realize that I can move the access control into the web-application, but as we've built a platform for others to build applications on, I do not necessarily want to trust those application to enforce the security requirements. That is the key reason why we've build the access control into the entity layer.</p>

<p>Having that in mind, as far as I understand, that code would not be able to do any harm if you restrict the number of interrupts for it or disable interrupts whatsoever. One way to ensure there are no interrupts in code is to scan it instruction-wise and refuse to run if there is at least one <code>int</code> instruction in it. That will solve the problem, but this approach will as well disallow any system calls, and the code with no system calls is scarcely useful. If the running side decides to allow that code which only invokes some whitelisted interrupts, then the running side needs to be sure that the running code does not change itself in run time. If it does change, then each instruction to run needs to be re-scanned, what would impact performance.</p>

<p>It would be nice to have some kind of gateway between host and guest interrupts, which could translate guest interrupts to possibly different host interrupts or refuse to do so. Are there any solutions or researches available for this topic?</p>

<p>I have tried different ways of authentication, but still has some misunderstandings, so I need advice of someone more experienced.    </p>

<p>Let me tell, how I understand all this stuff. If I understand something incorrectly, please let me know.    </p>

<p>As far as REST API is stateless as well as WEB in general, we need to send some auth data in each request(cookies, token....). I know three widely used mechanisms to authenticate user </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Token with HTTPS. I have used this approach a lot of times it is good enough with HTTPS. If user provides correct password and login, he will receive token in response, and will use it for the further requests. Token is generated by the server and stored, for instance in the table separate or the same where user info is stored. So for each request server checks if user has token and it is the same as in the database. Everything is pretty straightforward.   </p></li>
<li><p>JWT Token. This token is self-descriptive, it contains all necessary information about the token itself, user cannot change for example expiration date or any other claim, because this token is generated (signed) by the server with secret keyword. This is also clear. But one big problem, personally for me, how to invalidate token. </p></li>
<li><p>OAuth 2. I don't understand why this approach should be used when communication is established directly between server and client. As far as I understand, OAuth server is used to issue token with restricted scope to allow other applications access user information without storing password and login. This is great solution for the social networks, when user wants to sign up on some page, server can request permissions to get user info, for instance from twitter or facebook, and fill registration fields with user data and so on.    </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Consider mobile client for online store.</p>

<p>First question should I prefer JWT over first type token ? As far as I need login/logout user on mobile client, I need to store somewhere token or in case of JWT, token should be invalidated on logout. Different approaches are used to invalidate token one of the is to create invalid token list (black list). Hmm. Table/file will have much bigger size than if token was stored in table and associated with user, and just removed on logout.    </p>

<p>So what are benefits of JWT token ?    </p>

<p>Second question about OAuth , should I use it in case of direct communication with my server?  What is the purpose of one more layer between client and server only to issue token, but communication will be not with oauth server but with the main server. As I understand OAuth server is responsible only for giving third-party apps permissions (tokens) to access user private information. But my mobile client application is not third-party.</p>

<p>I implemented the check on my end, as per the spec, but I always wondered if this was necessary. After all, doesn't the UDP protocol itself carry a 16-bit CRC?

<p>Let's start with a given: in our system, a <em>Permission</em> will be a fine-grained unit of access (""<em>Edit resource X</em>"", ""<em>Access the dashboard page</em>"", etc.). A <em>Role</em> will be a collection of 1+ Permissions. A <em>User</em> can have 1+ Roles. All these relationships (Users, Roles, Permissions) are all stored in a database and can be changed on the fly and as needed.</p>

}

// vs.
if(SecurityUtils.hasPermission(user)) {
    // Grant them access to a feature

<blockquote>
  <p>(2) In this scenario what useful value do Roles even provide? Couldn't we just assign 1+ Permissions to Users directly? What <strong>concrete</strong> value of abstraction do Roles offer (can someone give specific examples)?</p>

<p>What would be the best way of getting around this possible security hole? Please comment on this method that I am planning to implement:</p>

<li>Whenever a request to download data for a username comes in, it must be accompanied by the string from the previous attempt. Also, each fresh update for the client is accompanied by a new random string, which is stored in the database and the old one is deemed expired.</li>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I'm talking about purely remote root / admin software exploits.  Not about insider physically breaking into labs / companies / houses / networks / machines.</p>

<p>Everytime there's a blog entry or article about a new security exploit there are lots and lots of people basically writing that: <em>""No software shall ever be secure, every single software out there can be exploited.

These type of comments always get modded like crazy and most people seems to accept it as a fact.</p>

<p>The more I think about it, the more I don't understand why we couldn't, technically, build 100% secure software.  All the way down from the OS and then up: browsers, plugins...</p>

<p>Note that I'm not interested in a discussion here: I want to know if technically there is something or not that can prevent, say, an OS, to be written in a 100% secure way and why it's that way.</p>

<p>Now if there's nothing technically that prevents us from writing a 100% secure OS and from then writing a 100% secure server, why hasn't it been done?  Does it means our architecture and development methodologies (and tools?) are deeply flawed?</p>

<p>I find that implementing some similar technology would be very interesting. But it seems like a major security hole. Am I wrong in thinking that exposing a compiler would be risky? An interpreter seems even worse.</p>

<p><strong>update:</strong> I can be a bit more specific. The kind service I'm thinking about hosting myself (a thought experiment at this stage) would be kind of close to the case of the Fay ide above. You take input from the user, process it and return it, potentially as runable javascript to the same or other users. Let's look at that example in particular.</p>

<p>The most obvious security concern that I see for this case, as I don't actually evaluate the code server side, would be for the users, as they would run code made by an 'unknown' author. The fact that they are allowed to read the code before running it should be a significant safeguard in this regard.</p>

<p>Although I also wonder if and when translation of code constitute a threat to the server? What kind of exploit vectors could be thought of in this context?</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li>Beyond what you can expect from any web server set up, and beyond the most obvious concerns (or perhaps some of those obvious concerns as well), how could one user compromise another?
-. How can the server application be hardened to ensure not being compromised?</li>
<li>What important questions have I neglected? ;)</li>
<li>I would like to try some experiments, and I have nearlyfreespeech in mind as a host. I could imagine that such use might be prohibited by their terms of use? Or perhaps I can trust them to be sure enough that they have sandboxed my account well enough. What should be my ""minimum"" safeguards, for trying stuff out and what safeguards would be possible with such limited hosting environment?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>update2:</strong> I believe that compiling to javascript for client side evaluation or evaluating limited edsls would cover for most/all use cases I have in mind. I take it that this means that I really don't put the server side to a more prominent risk than <em>usual</em>. And I don't see how the user is being put into more risk than compared to going to a random link on jsFiddle.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>I do research into developing new models for machine learning applications. Security of this research is of high importance. This is because developing a new model can be a difficult, time consuming task. However once a new model is understood, all of the coding necessary to leverage the research is often trivial. So it can be stolen very easily.</p>

<p>It seems very possible that data mining could be used to identify researchers. After which spyware (which may well already be on a device) can be used to steal research.</p>

<p><strong>My Solution so far:</strong></p>

<p>I've been doing all of my testing on a newly wiped system that is entirely not connected nor ever connected to the internet (network card removed)</p>

<p>Other than that, I have encrypted all of the source as well as the entire hard drive separately using 7zip.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this is enough. </p>

<pre><code>GET /cats
GET /cats/{catId}
GET /dogs
</code></pre>

<p>Clients decide whether they can perform an action based on resource permissions. To query those the client calls:</p>

<pre><code>GET /cats/{catId}/permissions
</code></pre>

<p>And gets back a list like ""deleteCat"", ""sellCat"", ""initiateCatMating"" etc., so its more complicated than read, write etc, i.e. calling OPTIONS is not working.</p>

<p>Now when the client gets let's say 100 cats, it has to call the permission endpoint 100 times. Resources are related, so the number of permission calls virtually explodes, to the amount of slowing the UI down when working with big lists.</p>

<p>I was thinking whether it would be a good/acceptable practice to include the permissions in all resources, like:</p>

<pre><code>cat: {
name:string
permissions:[string]
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way the client will always know what it can do with the resource. Unfortunatelly I could not find any guidance on this, so this approach is either wrong or people just implement it as they like and don't care to ask questions. All I found were some ABAC references, which totally make sense, but solve I think only how the server can handle access easier. I want the client to know if it may call POST/cats/{catId}/matingPartner/{cat2Id} by knowing it has e.g. ""initiateCatMating"" permission for both cats, and if it doesn't than the ""Choose mating partner"" button should not appear in the UI.</p>

<ol>
<li>Web application(.Net Web Forms) connects to third party web service via wcf.</li>
<li>Third party web service accepts only digitally signed soap requests</li>
<li>Some typical business processes consist of several soap requests. </li>
<li>User must start business process (send several soap requests) via web application and digitally sign it in the front-end by its certificate (smart-card holding its certificate). Web application doesn't store any user certificates, it only stores user data that must be sent to web service.</li>
</ol>

<p>My current thoughts are to create some proxy web service that would intercept user soap requests without digital signatures and put them into database. Then user would open some web form where he would see all requests that he must digitally sign. User signs requests via some web browser plugin. As the result of that operation web application gets digitally signed requests that it can send to original web service.</p>

<p>There is some problem with this realization though - it doesn't consider any if's logic and it can't use results gained from previous requests. The process of information exchange between web application and web service must be straightforward since user sends requests to fake proxy web service that can't return real data and results. So we would send data as-is hoping that there would be no results that our process of informational exchange would depend on. </p>

<p>Another option is to digitally sign all requests to web service in real-time. But I can't get how to do it in WCF. I can use IClientMessageInspector and intercept message before it would be sent to web service. In theory I can make some callback at this moment to frontend and wait for user to digitally sign request and then replace original request to user's one. But current realization of web application doesn't allow any callbacks to front end in WCF.</p>

<p>Any thoughts would be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Say I have a website called <code>dashboard.com</code> and this is only for <code>US region</code>. When users login here, I am storing their session into <code>USRedis</code> instance. However this dashboard has two buttons named <code>USWebApp</code> and <code>EUWebApp</code>. </p>

<p>Assume that this is the UI for <code>dashboard.com</code> (pardon for text based UI). The doted elements indicate html buttons. So I have two buttons named <code>USWebApp</code> and <code>EUWebApp</code></p>

<pre><code>http://www.dashboard.com

----------    ----------
|USWebApp|    |EUWebApp|
----------    ----------
</code></pre>

<p>Once user is logged into <code>dashboard.com</code> and clicks <code>USWebApp</code>, I pass the session cookie to <code>USWebApp</code> and <code>USWebApp</code> calls <code>USRedis</code> to validate the session. If session is not valid, then we redirect the user back to <code>dashboard.com</code> (and user logs in again by typing credentials). </p>

<p>On the contrary, user can click <code>EUWebApp</code>. Again I am passing <code>dashboard.com</code>'s session cookie to <code>EUWebApp</code>. However <code>EUWebApp</code> checks <code>EURedis</code> to validate this session. However when user logged into <code>dashboard.com</code> I only persisted their session to <code>USRedis</code>. So when <code>EUWebApp</code> tries to validate this session by looking in <code>EURedis</code>, it won't find the session since I never wrote to <code>EURedis</code> when user logged into <code>dashboard.com</code> (main site) in the first place to begin with.</p>

<p>Two solutions that I can think to solve this</p>

<p>1) <code>EUWebApp</code> should talk to <strong>only</strong> <code>USRedis</code>, to validate the session instead of talking to <code>EURedis</code> or</p>

<p>2) when user logs into <code>dashboard.com</code> I should store their session in both <code>USRedis</code> and <code>EURedis</code>. Therefore <code>USWebApp</code> can use <code>USRedis</code> while <code>EUWebApp</code> can use <code>EURedis</code> to validate the user session.</p>

<p>Basically, once a request reaches our servers without having a valid key, we add a key as a query parameter of the url, then return a redirect response to the client with the same url but with a valid key. </p>

<p>Then we can use this key to throttle the requests instead of using an IP Address.</p>

<p>I understand that the attacker might still make millions of new requests to the server, but redirecting the client should be fairly lighter than say downloading a video or large file.</p>

So first, of course this bot is not a professional project, but I still want it to look as professional as possible. And a huge part is the storage and process of user data. Sure, I won't get data like Credit Card info, private adress or workplace. I just want a user account, where you can personalize the bot for your server. So all the data I may have are a username, a hashed password and an e-mail (I'm still drawing a concept. Not sure if I need a mail, or use Discord for Authentication). But nevertheless, I want to secure that data, like it's really valuable.</p>

<p>So my first idea was to safe the data into an SQLite-Database, which I already use for the Bot itself (Things like Money, or Userlists are stored there). But you cannot properly secure such a database, it's not SQL. Another idea was something like a single encrypted file, where all the data is stored. but that can get messy and eat storage really easily.</p>

<p>Also, even if I would store it into the SQLite-Database, I still could see everything. The password may be encrypted, but username and e-mail won't be.
As I said, it may not be a big thing, but I also write this bot to learn things for future projects, and safe data storage is really important.</p>

<p>How can I save data like username+password or e-mail adress, while making sure that the data is unlikely to be exposed to anyone, including me? And also important, how can I process this data (I'm using C# for the bot), cause that's what data is for.</p>

<p>Primarily we are using OAuth based APIs to connect with these services. One of the <em>user interaction</em> problems we are facing is that our users do not expect that after they login to an external service that they stay logged into it. That sounds silly, but the scenario is this:</p>

<p>Here's an example: let's say your skill/app allows you to call a cab. So you'd say something like ""Alexa, call me a cab"". Now, if there's no additional security at all, anyone in proximity of your voice assistant could call a cab in your name - not ideal.</p>

<p>A fixed PIN or password can provide some level of security: ""Alexa, call me a cab!"" - ""Sure thing, what's the PIN?"" - ""It's 1234!""</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if you do this frequently, someone will eventually overhear your PIN or password. Could be your malicious neighbor, or simply your mischievous kids. So that's still vulnerable.</p>

<p>What I would imagine to be more secure would be some sort of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge%E2%80%93response_authentication"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Challenge–response authentication</a> protocol that's easy enough for humans to implement in their head - something like: ""Alexa, call me a cab!"" - ""Ok, security check: my challenge is 72, what is your response?"" - ""It's 10."" </p>

<p>The tricky part here is that computing the response would have to be very easy- most humans, of course, won't be able to compute a cryptographic hash function in their head. But something straightforward such as ""add 7 to the challenge"" would probably be good enough to prevent your toddler from calling a cab on your behalf. Once they're in elementary school, you'd have to switch to something a little bit more sophisticated like ""add hour of the day and day of the month"".</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>I'm currently working on a project which involves the daily extraction of data (pharmacy records) from a VisualFox Pro database, and uploading some of it to a WordPress site, where clients of the pharmacy can securely view it. I would like some advice in terms of the general methodology of my software - I am able to code it, but need to know if I'm going the right way about it. I'm writing both the PC software (in C#/.NET 4.5) and the PHP WordPress plugin. (It doesn't matter much that it's in WordPress, the actual code for this will pretty much run separately).</p>

<h2>Question 1: Encryption</h2>

<p>The current process for encrypting the data server-side I plan to use is based on <a href=""http://i.amniels.com/mysql-database-encryption-using-public-private-keys"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a>. Summarised, it advocates encrypting each separate user's data asymmetrically with their own public key, stored on the server. The private key to decrypt this data is then itself encrypted symmetrically using the user's password, and stored. This way, even if the database is stolen, the user's password hash needs to be broken, and even then the process needs to be repeated for every user's data.</p>

<p>The only weakness, pointed out by the author himself, and the main point of my question, is the fact that while the user is logged in, the decrypted key is stored in session storage. The way the article suggests to deal with it is to just limit the time the user is logged in. I thought a better solution would be to store that key in a short-lived secure cookie (of course the whole process is happening over HTTPS). That way, if the attacker has control of the user's computer and can read their cookies, they can probably just keylog their password and log in, no need to steal the database, while even if the attacker gains access to the server, they cannot decrypt the HTTPS traffic (or can they? I'm not sure.)</p>

<p><strong>Should I use secure cookies or session storage to temporarily store the decrypted key?</strong></p>

<h2>Question 2: Storage</h2>

<p>The second thing I still want to work out is how to store the data - this is more of an efficiency problem. Since every user has their own key for encryption, it follows that records for every user must be stored separately. I don't know if I should store a ""block"" of data for every user, containing encrypted JSON with an array of objects representing records, or whether I should store records in a table with the actual data structure, and encrypt each data field separately with the key.</p>

<p>I am leaning towards storing the data as one block - it seems to me to be more efficient to decrypt one big block of data at a time, than perhaps several thousands separate fields. Also, even if I stored the data in its proper structure, I still wouldn't be able to use MySQL's WHERE, ORDERBY etc, since the data would all be BLOBs.</p>

<p><strong>Should I store the data as a big block per user, or separated into the different fields?</strong></p>

<h2>Question 3: Transfer</h2>

<p>I extract the data from the DBF file, and essentially make a ""diff"", whereby I compare the current extracted data from the last day's data, and only upload the blocks of the users that have changed (I can't only upload the records, as I probably will end up storing the users' data in blocks). I also include ""delete"" instructions for users which have been deleted. This is as there are hundreds of thousands records in the database, totalling over 200mb, and the size increases every day.</p>

<p>My current plan is to write all this data to a JSON file, gzip it and upload it to the server. My question is, how do I do that while ensuring the security of the data? Naturally, the upload will happen over HTTPS, and I have an API password in place to only allow authorised uploads, but my main concern is how to protect the data if the server is compromised. I don't want the attacker to just grab the JSON file from the server while it's being processed. One idea I had was to get the server to send me a list of public keys for the users, and perform the encryption in my software, before the upload. It seems to me like that's the only way of protecting that data. I could encrypt the whole JSON file, perhaps with an API key or a special password, but that's moot if the attacker can just access the decrypted file as it's being processed on the server. Is that a good solution?</p>

<p><strong>Should I encrypt the data individually client-side, or is there a way to securely transfer it to the server and encrypt it there?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any answers, I'd love to hear from someone who's dealt with problems like this before.</p>

<p>Matt</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: I'm pretty decided on 1 and 2 - thanks @Morons. I'll use secure cookies and store data in blocks. My main question is now question 3, would love to get some input on that.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT 1: Thank you for the many responses. This is very helpful to me as I didn't take the traditional route to this career and have some holes in my knowledge that probably seem fundamental to you. Here are a few points of clarification:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am a freelancer on my first-ever freelancing project, and the client/customer is a  professor. I am not his student, and this is not an assignment. </li>
<li>My task is to replace an existing application that is very old and for which the source code is lost.</li>
<li>The application is used in a class taught by several professors in different schools in the US. Much of the content is just static, like a textbook. However you can also take some questionnaires/instruments developed by the professors to get insight into the topic of the course relative to a real-world example of your choosing (i.e., the information you supply is not about yourself or other people). </li>
<li>My original goals in having username/passwords was to identify users so that I could enforce expiration of access to the content, and also control permissions. Permissions matter because in addition to students, there is the concept of administrator users (who have a dashboard where they can view lists of username/passwords they have created, and create more) and a super-admin (who in addition to what admins can do, can create other admin users).</li>
<li>The primary reason I started down the path of username and login is because that is what the old app had. But, the old app stored (lots!) of student information. The professor in charge now does not want to go afoul of <a href=""https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FERPA</a> laws so he has changed the requirements there.</li>
<li>A professor can create another username/password set and add it to the current class if needed. But they aren't forced to currently. (They can just give out the original password.) This was the professor's decision when I asked him if he wanted a ""reset password"" button on the list.</li>

<p>From what I understand, computer operators are supposed to be confined to hardware and hard data. They are not supposed to have anything to do with systems programming or applications programming, because of potential conflicts of interest. I follow this so far.</p>

<p>Likewise, the access of applications programmers are supposed to be limited to applications programs. They are not supposed to have anything to do with the systems programs that control their programs, or with the hard data or hardware. Again, this seems to follow.</p>

<p>The ""symmetry"" is broken with systems programmers. They are supposed to work with systems, and understandably, are not supposed to have access to applications programs. But my understanding is that they are allowed to have access to the hard data and hardware, when the other two types of personnel aren't allowed outside their areas. Why might this be?</p>

<p>I'm also confused about the roles of two more agents, systems and administrators and systems analysts. Maybe the problem is that I'm getting hung up on the job titles.</p>

<p>Systems administrators are ""keepers of the seal"" such as providing access abd passwords to the systems. Yet, they are not supposed to have access to the systems, only to applications. Is their function actually an ""applications"" function, despite their job titles?</p>

<p>Ditto for systems analysts, who oversee and work with applications programmers, and in this regard, are ""applications"" people who have access to applications. But they're not supposed to have access to systems, despite their job titles.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification:</strong> In answer to a comment, the question can be restated as follows (in two parts). 1) Why are systems programmers allowed to go outside of systems, (to hardware) when applications programmers and hardware people are expected to stick to issues connected with their departments? 2) why do systems administrators and systems analysts appear have the same scope as ""applications"" programmers when the term ""systems"" is in their job titles?</p>

They also permit access only from one IP address -- <strong>the client (B)</strong>. On each database server, we need to store <strong>read-only secret identity information (like email address, username, etc.)</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>I need a solution that prevents a hacker who may have compromised server (A) from being able to do anything with the data unless they also gain access to server (B).</strong></p>

<p>I need a strategy where client server (B) uses a public key from a private/public API key pair to find a match for this identity information (like an email address) on server (A), and then, without server (A) evaluating that result, return the result back to (B) for evaluation using its private key. <em>The theory being that if the hacker gets root level access to server (A), they can't do anything with it to decode the data, not even with brute-force attacks on md5(), sha1(), sha256(), or against any hashing algorithm.</em></p>

<p><strong>Here's a strategy that won't work, as an example.</strong> Imagine you have PHP's libsodium (a common public/private key system). You use it to encrypt the data and store it on (A). Then, when (B) wants to do a lookup, they send in the public key, it gets mated with the private key on (A), a hash is generated, and that hash is checked against a hash in the database. (So, you find if hashed email request matches a hashed email address in the database.) The problem with this strategy is that if server (A) is compromised for root-level access, all the attacker has to do is intercept the web traffic to find the public key from (B), combine it with the private key from (A) in the PHP server scripts, and then use that information to run a powerful brute-force script to break the hash so that the entire database can be decrypted. This brute-force attack has been used to break md5() and sha1(), but can be used to break even someone's sha256 or other hash API. </p>

<p><strong>Right, so that won't work.</strong> <em>It would be better if there was some way that the result of the match can't be interpreted on server (A) and must be sent back to server (B) for final evaluation, which then requires server (B)'s private key to decrypt the result.</em></p>

<p><strong>Using PHP</strong>, can you explain a programmer API key strategy where a compromised data store will yield no useful information to a hacker unless he has the private key of that programmer's public/private key pair?</p>

<hr>

<p>I am working on an enterprise data discovery project that is designed to scan databases for sensitive information. The basic search unit is called a classifier and covers things like 'Social Security Number', 'LastName', 'Driver's License', 'Credit Card Number', etc.</p>

<p>Currently, each classifier is an independent item with its own regex pattern, so a search for 'Driver's License' will yield matches for any pattern that matches the format ^[A-Z]\d{3}-\d{4}-\d{4}$. </p>

<p>We want to reduce false positives from this approach by leveraging data from related classifiers. For instance, if both my last name and driver's license number appear in the same record, I should be able to verify that the first letter of my last name matches the first character of the driver's license number instead of only relying on the regex pattern.</p>

<p>Here's another example: suppose I am searching for 'Zip Codes' on a database and a scan marks the following records as matches:</p>

<pre><code>FirstName LastName 123 Fake Street City, Illinois 61234
012345678 01234567 012345678 987654321 1234556 61234
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to assign a higher confidence rating to the first match, because it is located near related classifiers like 'Street Address' and 'State' while the second match is probably a false positive from a stream of unrelated digits.</p>

<hr>

<p>What kind of problem domain is involved here and what existing algorithms apply? I've looked through articles on record linkage, semantic matching, information extraction, and other things, but I can't seem to find research on the exact idea I'm explaining.</p>

<hr/> 

<p><strong>Premise</strong></p>

<p>I am building this application in Python that needs to be deployed on premise of the client. This application runs constantly like a service spewing out stats. This application is based on a subscription model.</p>

<hr/> 

<p><strong>Considerations</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Ensuring the IP is intact as the application resides on the client.

<ul>
<li>Achieving this by building a binary using Cython</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When subscription ends the application should not run. 

<ul>
<li>Thinking of using HOTP(HMAC based OTP) so each client will have a seed baked into the executable. HOTP uses a seed and time to generate a symmetric key. So for every time slot say 1 month, a new key should be given to the executable. </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<hr/> 

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Is there a better way to achieve this?</li>
<li>How can the application keep time in tamper-proof way? (As OS time is not reliable). <br/> <em>Or</em><br/> How do I store the count of time slots in a secure way such that it cannot be hacked?</li>
<li>As this is a service that is always running, how do I enforce a check at the end of a time slot like 1 month? Also as the application is on-prem, it can be shut down.</li>
</ol>

<p>One ugly way is encrypting and storing an timer.txt which is constantly updated by a separate python process. Is there a better way?</p>

<hr/> 

<p><strong>The above is with consideration of no-internet.</strong></p>

<p>But even if internet exists, it does not guarantee a fool-proof solution, because the network can be monitored and calls to an API can be redirected to a local service with the same name. Does this mean there should be two-way SSL here? </p>

It responds with the requested data in addition to setting a session cookie. Subsequent requests can be made with no auth headers as the cookie is used in its stead.</p>

<p>Originally, no auth was handled on the node server. API requests were all made directly from browser. This made auth simple, as the client entered user/pass was sent directly in headers and received a session cookie in return.</p>

<p>Now, however, we would like to move towards doing initial payload rendering on the server. This will require both the Server and Client to be ""authorized"" with web API. What are some common approaches to doing this?</p>

<p>A couple of possibilities that occurred to me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Client auths with API as before, API sets cookie for future browser requests, client copies cookie to node server (which stores in session) for use in future server requests.</li>
<li>Client sends user/pass to node server, node server auths and stores cookie in session, all subsequent API calls run through node server.</li>
<li>Client sends user/pass to node server, client auths normally, node server auths normally.</li>
</ul>

<p>First option seems ideal (if possible). This is how I would imagine one would use an ""access token"". Is it possible to use cookies like this? Are there cross origin restrictions that pertain to cookies that I am overlooking? For instance, I know that this does not work the other way around (I cannot auth on server, put API cookie in response to browser, and have the client use that cookie for a different path (the web API instead of the node server).</p>

<p>Second option I really want to avoid as it seems like a lot of unnecessary traffic on the node server, a lot of boilerplate routes, and our web API is already very simple to use directly from browser. Performance wise, this also adds one additional stop. Ideally, the node server should be serving page requests and thats it.</p>

<p>Third option just seems kind of silly. It results in the same user being authed in multiple places, which the web API may or may not like (I didn't design it nor do I know its inner working). We are also sending username password over the wire twice (which logically seems less secure than once).</p>

Are there any best-practices available, recommended reading, or other pointers you can give me make my service usable but not abusable? </p>

<p>Here's what I've considered so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove <code>__builtins__</code> from the <code>exec</code> context to prohibit use of potentially dangerous packages like <code>os</code>. Users will only be able to use packages I provide to them.</li>
<li>Use threads to enforce a reasonable timeout.</li>
<li>I'd like to limit the total amount of memory that can be allocated within the <code>exec</code> context, but I'm not sure if it's even possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some alternatives to a straight <code>exec</code>, but I'm not sure which of these would be helpful here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using an <code>ast.NodeVisitor</code> to catch any attempt to access unsafe objects. But what objects should I prohibit?</li>
<li>Searching for any double-underscores in the input. (less graceful than the above option).</li>
<li>Using <code>PyPy</code> or something similar to sandbox the code.</li>

They want to have an app for their customers where they can find their insurance related things in. Some of these systems provide web services to get the necessary information, so proper user authentication and whatsoever is possible. However, some provide direct database access without anything which comes even close to user authentication, because it was not designed to do that.</p>

<p>To solve this issue we are building an adapter-service, which can connect to all the different systems to get the necessary data. However the user-authentication is still an issue for the systems which don't provide that.</p>

<p>Another software engineer suggested (we are the only engineers) we build a general authentication mechanism which provides authentication to all the systems to get the necessary customer information. We both have the same background, we are young, we don't have that much experience in designing such a system or understanding all the security issues for such a system.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> With the background as stated above, I am concerned about all the security concerns which may come up if we would do that. That for the serious kind of information (insurance data) we may lack the experience to set up a system like that, to ensure the best kind of security is possible and not limited by our knowledge (or Google). </p>

<ul>
<li>His opinion on this matter is that a general authentication mechanism should be build for all systems. So with one login on our side they can get all the data from the different systems if it is available there. If we follow up with things such as OAuth that we don't have to fear the security issue that much. And if we (re)search these things on the internet, that it will be OK.</li>
<li>My opinion on this matter is that a general authentication mechanism will be a good thing for all the systems which don't provide the necessarry things for user authentication (which is also possible the only solution). However we should not override systems which provide their own authentication to access their system to get the necessary data from a customer. Perhaps information can be exchanged between all the systems to ensure the same kind of login is  available everywhere (if user exists in a system which provides authentication and with a systems which uses the general authentication). If an password for example is changed. This idea would make sure if our general authentication mechanism is breached somehow, that not all the systems will be exposed to the attacker, and who knows what the consequences might be.    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Should we just go through with the idea to make a general authentication mechanism or limit it to the systems who need it and possible exchange login-details if the user should exist in the two different kind of systems (system which supports authentication or doesn't). What are good arguments for or against these ideas?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The general public would be using it, each system would provide the contract(s) with its data (if the customer exists in the different systems). Example: for customer '1' system A (database) and B (web-service) contains both different contracts from him. However, for customer '2' only system A (database) contains a contract. Depending on the customer their kind of contract(s) they are stored in different systems. All of these systems are third party.</p>

<p>Assume that library developers produced the compiler flags and were a consideration at design and test phases of the library.</p>

<p>As most design decisions, there are tradeoffs, in this case the code complexity and product quality unarguably suffer due to the increased branches to design and test against.</p>

<p>However with regards to security, the net impact is not clear, there are both positive and negative effects from removing features. Initially, removing code reduces the surface of attack. But on the other hand, building a custom binary means that a bug, and thus exploit, might be present in that specific combination.</p>

<p>The implications differ from those of traditional runtime path complexity, not just because of the consideration of 2 different types of branching, but because compiler condition syntax is far unsafer than its runtime counterpart (at least in C).</p>

<p>An interesting phenomenon is that building a custom binary might expose the users to targetted attacks, but using a standard build might expose the users to mass exploits.</p>

<p>The question is, considering there are both positive and negative influences on security, if we were to quantify them, would the net impact be positive or negative? In other, less academic words, if one is concerned with security, should they build a custom binary without the features they need?</p>

<p>User authentication is done with OpenID Connect, I'm sending an ID and access token to the client, the client uses the access token to call the API's.</p>

<p>At this stage, the API's know they receive a request from an authenticated user, but they still need to know what that user can do, the Authorization part.</p>

<p>I would like to prevent the scenario where all my API's call a store where authorization data is persisted, it feels like a performance bottleneck, and would tightly couple all my API's.</p>

<p>I would like to keep my OpenID Connect server as decoupled from this specific project as possible, processing only the users's identity and API scope claims. Therefore, putting all authorization-related claims inside the access token seems like the wrong move.</p>

<p>I came up with the following solution:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>User navigates to SPA</p></li>
<li><p>SPA calls OpenID Connect server, gets an access token with identity info</p></li>
<li><p>SPA calls a custom API endpoint, specific for this project, lets call it 'user-info-api'</p></li>
<li><p>This API issues a custom JWT token, signed by cert or shared secret</p></li>
<li><p>This custom JWT token is appended on every subsequent API request, it contains all info needed to do user authorization in each API, therefore eliminating round trips to the authorization store. The only thing the API's need to do is to verify it's signature</p></li>
</ul>

Now the server can use its private key to decrypt the secret key and further use the decrypted secret key to decrypt the data</p>

<p>In my database, I have a ""user"" table that stores the user's information, including their username, encrypted password, first name, last, name, email address, etc.</p>

<p>Now, I've decided that the usernames will <em>always</em> be email addresses since the users won't be able to interact with each other (therefore, no sensitive data security issues). The problem is I have both an ""username"" and an ""email"" column. As of now, when the user create their account, they don't type in an username and an email. They type in an email, which gets passed into the two SQL columns.</p>

<p>Later on, they can change their username and email address separately and both could technically be different. I realize now that this might not be ideal and rewriting the parts of the code affected by this, changing the database structure, etc. is going to to take a little bit of work, which I'm 100% willing to do, but not sure yet if it's necessary at all, so that's why I'm asking this question here.</p>

Now, I still need a way to make sure that only accounts allowed by me have access to the software; I plan to do this in the orange layer above.

If not, I would not allow them access to the software / secure route. The SQL database account entries will be added by me manually.</p>

<p>I figured this was a great solution because it removes the need for me to store sensitive password / user information in my database. I would only be storing an some ID's (Email address, etc...) to Microsoft accounts that I allow in.</p>

<p>Isn't knowing the hash kind of just as bad as knowing the password? If you found out the hash, you could use the service for nefarious means because all the password is used for is generating the hash, and the hash is used for all further authentication.</p>

<p>I have been trying to think about this and I can't think of any place to do that.  I mean I can't store it in javascript because anyone can just view the source or open up the console and get the data.  I am not 100% sure how secure localStorage is and if users can access/modify that data.  Even if local storage was secure, the two ways I can think of getting data into it are not.  One way is to just store the data in the javascript source code which is the most insecure thing I can think of.

<li>a client posts username and password to a login route</li>

<li>the client keeps the token and adds it to any protected api calls</li>

<p>Now say I can see all client http in/out calls.

<p>For example, in a role-based security, different roles will have different access to some UI interactions on the same view. If, for instance, we have an online store, on the products list page the customers can only view the details and add items to their cart, but an administrator must be also presented with <code>Add Product</code> buttons and <code>Delete</code> button on each item. </p>

<p><a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/56103/mvp-pattern-philsophical-question-security-checking-in-ui"">Similar question</a> has been asked here already, but the OP is asking for the UI making the permission checks. I am certain the UI (view) should not be responsible for permission validation, but still it has to know whether to visualize or not certain UI components. So, is there any well-defined or widely adopted pattern for telling the view which UI interactions it should disallow? I can think of a few solutions, but if there is a standard and proven one, I'd prefer to stick with that, rather than reinventing the wheel.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>To clarify a bit further, as suggested in answers below, I am considering the approach of having the view accept the privileges information from the presenter. It is the form of that information that bothers me - if using flags as bit masks or some too-generic representation I will:</p>

<ol>
<li>(+) Gain consistency in passing the permissions to the view</li>
<li>(-) Couple the view with logic for resolving the flags. </li>
</ol>

<p>The other thing I have in mind is having the View expose all the flags it needs as settable properties for the presenter (like <code>view.IsDeleteItemAllowed</code>). So I will:</p>

<ol>
<li>(+) Not have additional logic for the permissions in the view</li>
<li>(-) Add additional complexity to presenter to adapt permission flags to the view's properties.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>So, I am thinking of using the later approach, because that way I can reuse the presenter with different view implementations; and will not rely on the view for understanding the permissions system (which may be a subject of changes). Is there anything I should worry about with that?</p>

e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li>Password1!</li>
<li>Secret2$</li>
<li>Password3!</li>
<li>Secret4$</li>
</ul>

<p>This antipattern works because:</p>

<ul>
<li>any new passwords is completely different from the previous one</li>
<li>the history of hashes does not contain any exact match</li>
</ul>

<p>is there any algorithm which is ""similar"" to an hash but allows to extract a distance metric from the current plain text password in order to avoid those risks?</p>

<p><strong>Here is my analysis so far</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Hashing explicitly requires that ""similiar"" passwords turn to very different hashes: otherwise it would be very easy to converge from a generic password toward the one that generated the hash. Any ""hash""-like algorithm which allows to calculate a metric of distance from the current password would be a security threat.</li>
<li>I can't think of any workaround to come up with an hash which allows to measure ""similarity"" without giving away some kind of ""distance"" metric: which as stated above would render it insecure</li>
<li>Another approach would be storing hashes of subsets of the password. E.g. we store the hash of the previous 10 passwords + the hash of the previous passwords minus the last two chars: this one would block the above example. However in order to work we might have to collect too many hashes of too small substrings (eg. every group of 6 chars) and this would give away the plain text password!</li>

What should you implement if you were to implement TLS today?</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you need to implement all of the previous versions? (SSL 1-3, TLS 1.0-1.3)</li>
<li>Do you need to implement all the cryptography algorithms, or just the TLS 1.3 ones? (RSA is not used in TLS 1.3 it looks like, but is the standard for HTTPS as far as I know, for example).</li>
<li>Do you need to implement all the <em>ciphers</em>, or just the TLS 1.3 ones?</li>
</ul>

<p>Rather than trying to describe what needs to be implemented in order to support TLS <em>today</em>, the simpler question is <strong>do browsers support TLS 1.3</strong>? If not, why not? This leads to the above questions, plus...</p>

<p>In order to fetch ""older"" websites, do you need to support older TLS protocols? Or can you have, let's say, a brand new TLS 1.3 implementation that only implements the following, and be good to go in terms of communicating with ""older"" sites and services? Basically TLS 1.3 seems to only implement:</p>

<ol>
<li>DHE-RSA</li>
<li>ECDHE-RSA</li>
<li>ECDHE-ECDSA</li>
<li>AES GCM</li>
<li>AES CCM</li>
<li>ChaCha20-Poly1305</li>
<li>AEAD</li>
</ol>

<p>That's only 7 things, meanwhile there are about 20 key exchange algorithms in the full range of TLS/SSL versions from SSL 1.0 to TLS 1.3, and about 20 ciphers, and 6 data integrity algorithms.</p>

<p>Basically, in order to support browsing the web <em>if TLS was implemented today</em> in a new open source project for example, would it only need to write the code for those 7 things, or all 20 + 20 + 6 ~ 46 algorithms, basically supporting all SSL and TLS versions of the past?</p>

<p>I am basically confused as to what needs to be implemented to support secure web browsing in the 21st century, given that everything before TLS 1.3 has been found to be insecure (it seems like). The answer to this question would help me come up with a project scope on what it would take to implement TLS properly today.</p>

<p>If you can't just implement TLS 1.3 (and need to support the older TLS/SSL versions), what happens if you only had TLS 1.3? What about only TLS 1.3 and 1.2? etc. Basically, what handicaps do you have by only supporting the latest version. Does it mean simply that you can't fetch certain webpages, or what?</p>

<p>It sounds like browsers have stopped supporting SSL 3.0 and before for a while now, but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>It isn't like that on vanilla Linux. Applications can access anything they want, albeit not granting them to modify files, but nevertheless.

This is the classic Fronted + Backend (Angular + Java EE) application to which I am currently adding authentication and authorization. However, the matter does not seem to be simple for several reasons. First, there are different kinds of customers who will use this application:</p>

<ol>
<li>end-user using GUI (Angular calls the Backend API)</li>
<li>end-users using direct backend API</li>
<li>another system calling the API backend</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, I have an OIDC provider (OIDC_Organization) available in my organization - unfortunately it can only authenticate users. Does not return any information about roles. And my application also needs information about which roles belong to the logged in user. For this reason, I would like to build my own OIDC system (OIDC_Internal), which would delegate authentication to an existing system (OIDC_Organization) in the organization. And from the database I manage (Permission_DB) it would read user permissions / roles. I would return such combined information (id user + role) in new OAuth token(s) to my application. However, I would not like to implement from scratch the entire OIDC system (OIDC_Internal). There must be for sure best options for this. 
The another problem is also that I can't put any technical users in OIDC_Organization. Only real users are there. So for option (1) and (2) I can use OIDC_Organization but for option (3) I need to have a user account in a different place (e.g. in the authorization database that I have -> Permission_DB).</p>

<p>Below is the diagram that seems necessary to ensure security for Application 1. I assume that Authorization Code Flow will be used for the communication of App1-> OIDC_Internal and OIDC_Internal-> OIDC_Organization.

<p>I was thinking about using Keyclock as a kind of proxy-provider but I don't know if this solution is even possible to implement. For example I don't want to show Keyclock's login page - the login page provided by OIDC_Organization would be sufficient. Maybe would you suggest writing your own solution using some Oauth / OIDC / JWT support libraries?</p>

<p>For simplicity let us assume that I have ~50-60 such groups and in each group, I have around 1000 Jobs. Run users are Unix users, a user with which Job runs.</p>

<p>If you look closely you will notice that this is cross-group directed acyclic graph of Jobs. Hence I am thinking to build an event-driven system for triggering these Jobs and for that I am thinking to use Kafka. </p>

<ol>
<li>Producer: Each invocation of a Job is a separate process. These are my producers (short lived).</li>
<li>Consumer: Assume we have one consumer per run user. I am not sure how do I trigger Jobs for cases when Job is dependent on more than one event (i.e. for completion of more than one Job)?</li>
<li>Topics: I am not sure about Kafka Topics. Should I have

<ul>
<li>One topic per group?</li>
<li>One topic per user?</li>
<li>One topic per group per user? Or,</li>
<li>One topic per user per group per job?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Basically I want to solve the following use-cases:</p>

<p><strong>Usecase 1</strong> Secretive Job A run by user x depends on secretive Job B run by user Y. Neither A nor B wants to tell anyone in the world about their existence. A and B need to trust each other which means they can know the existence of each other.</p>

<p><strong>Usecase 2</strong> Public Job A run by user x depends on secretive Job B run by user Y</p>

<p><strong>Usecase 3</strong> Secretive Job A run by user x depends on public Job B run by user Y</p>

<p><strong>Usecase 4</strong> Public Job A run by user x depends on public Job B run by user Y</p>

<p>Any ideas on how should I go about designing</p>

<li>Kafka topics from the secure setup perspective to solve use-cases above.</li>
<li>How do I consume events and launch Jobs (for jobs that depend on multiple other Jobs)?</li>

<p><strong>2nd update:</strong></p>

<p>Reading the security specs for OAuth, it seems that there is no real answer to my question - since the client and server must know the secret keys and the client is locally stored on our users' mobile devices (as opposed to a web app).</p>

<p>From the OAuth security guide (<a href=""http://hueniverse.com/oauth/guide/security/"">http://hueniverse.com/oauth/guide/security/</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When implementing OAuth, it is critical to understand the limitations of shared secrets, symmetric or asymmetric. The client secret (or private key) is used to verify the identity of the client by the server. In case of a web-based client such as web server, it is relatively easy to keep the client secret (or private key) confidential.</p>
  
  <p>However, when the client is a desktop application, a mobile application, or any other client-side software such as browser applets (Flash, Java, Silverlight) and scripts (JavaScript), the client credentials must be included in each copy of the application. This means the client secret (or private key) must be distributed with the application, which inheritably compromises them.</p>
  
  <p>This does not prevent using OAuth within such application, but it does limit the amount of trust the server can have in such public secrets. Since the secrets cannot be trusted, the server must treat such application as unknown entities and use the client identity only for activities that do not require any level of trust, such as collecting statistics about applications. Some servers may opt to ban such application or offer different protocols or extensions. However, at this point there is no known solution to this limitation.</p>

<p>What are the methods to make sure that calls made from somewhere else (e.g. someone wanting all our data, or building an unofficial app) are rejected?</p>

<p>My initial idea is for the device to ask the server for a token, which is randomly generated and sent as is. All other methods will check that the request headers contain a specific one that will be md5 hash of the salted token.  The server knows the token and salt and is able to compute the hash and compares it with the one sent. In addition, the token as a limited lifespan, and the device must get another one every other hour.</p>

<p>Generally, the process requires you to visit a malicious site that has a hidden URL that will perform an action against the authenticated site (via <code>img</code> tags, for example).

<p>I'm using a small program (I won't name it, to not enlarge enough large shame on its author) that uses my Google account for some tasks. I've noticed, that it stores my password in plain-text unencrypted file. Just a string, clearly seen to everyone, that can drag&amp;drop it to Notepad or use <code>F3</code> in Total Commander.</p>

<p>I have risen a ticket asking program author to fix this ASAP. I haven't got any reply yet, but my issue got one comment, that includes only above mentioned link to Wikipedia's ""<em>Security through obscurity</em>"" page.</p>

<p>How should I understand this comment? Is it pro or con my issue? At first I thought, that it supports my statement of fixing this ASAP. But then I found a Eric Raymond's Fetchmail example (in ""<em>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</em>""), who refused to implement config file encryption (passwords are stored in config file for Fetchmail), claiming that it is up to the user to assure security by not letting anyone ""from the outside"" access that configuration file.</p>

<p>This statement (or refusal) is often brought as example of <em>Security through obscurity</em>. And looking from this point of view, I'm completely wrong and that program author is right. He do not have to implement encryption of file with my password, it can remain there, stored unencrypted and it is I, who is responsible for assuring security by not giving anyone access to this file or by deleting it each time I stop using that soft.</p>

<p>(another question is, how can I achieve this on system as unsecure as Windows itself?)</p>

<p>Regular users will be able to sign up for an account via the web interface, but I need a small number of specific users to have admin privileges. Admin privileges may include inviting new users while in closed beta, or modifying resources belonging to regular users. At the moment, I have a user schema with a 'roles' field, which will allow a regular user to be elevated to an admin role - but how do I 'bootstrap' these users into place when there are no existing admin users?</p>
<p>These admin users need to exist in multiple environments, including testing environments where the db gets regularly wiped, as well as in production where the user should persist until the credentials are revoked (say if the person leaves the company).</p>
<p>The obviously stupid approach would be to just hard-code the creds for one admin user but that is clearly the worst idea of all time. I could manually insert the user into the database outside of the control of the app but allowing access to the db this way seems like it could present data integrity issues.</p>
<p>I'm using Amazon Secrets Manager to inject things like database credentials where they live as environment variables in the pod/container so it occurs to me I could do something similar for admin credentials, but how should the code handle this to create a user?</p>
<p>One option would be to have a function that runs once on startup each time a new instance of the code starts up which grabs the user credentials from AWS, checks if the users exist in the db already, and if they don't create a new user with the Admin role - and when the person leaves I'd need to delete the credentials from AWS and get another admin user to delete them from the app also. Or I could just store a list of known Admin email addresses and when they sign up as a regular user they automatically get the Admin role. Both of these options seem kind of off to me.</p>
<p>Or should the Admin users not be users at all? Should there instead be a separate Admin &quot;login&quot; system, where the credentials are just checked against the AWS creds each time the Admin logs in, instead of creating a regular user in the db? This would mean I would only have to worry about revoking the creds stored in AWS secrets when the user leaves, and the code wouldn't have to redundantly check for existing Admin users each time a new instance spins up. Down side is I'd have to restructure my permissions system a little but this approach seems to be more secure. Are there any negative implications of doing it this way?</p>

<p>When I discover a new host on the network I want to ""block"" it until I authorized it but the machine is not a firewall nor a real Network Access Controller (NAC) so I can only use passive methods.</p>

<p>I have tried ARP cache poisoning to associate a fake MAC with the real gateway IP in the target host ARP cache but there is two major issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>The victim can manually set the ARP cache entry of the gateway as static.</li>
<li>The victim can still communicate with the other LAN hosts.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I tried another method: poison the ARP cache of every hosts on the network except the victim's one. I send a broadcast ARP request (works better than reply) with the IP of the victim and a fake MAC. But there is still one issue:</p>

<ul>
<li>When the victim try to communicate with another LAN host, it sends an ARP request which put the valid MAC and IP association in the other hosts ARP cache.</li>
<li>The victim can also manually sends ARP requests or replies to overwrite the fake MAC in the hosts ARP cache.</li>

<p>However, no matter how hard I try, I just cannot find reasonable arguments in favor of antivirus (and related security measures) on development machines.</p>

<p>Arguments against antivirus(AV) in development are plentiful:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is not uncommon for 1 minute build to take 10 times longer with AV on</li>
<li>In a conference talk, IntelliJ developers claim AV software is #1 suspect when their IDE is sluggish</li>
<li>Unzipping comes with roughly 100 kb/s speed with AV on</li>
<li>AV renders Cygwin completely unusable (vim takes 1 minute to open a simple file) </li>
<li>AV blocks me from downloading useful files (JARs, DLLs) from colleagues' e-mails</li>
<li>I can't use multiple computers for development, since AV / security measures prevent me from unblocking ports</li>
<li>AV kills performance of programs with high file turnover, such as Maven or Ant</li>
</ol>

<p>Last, but not least - what does AV actually protect me from? I am not aware of my AV program ever stopping any security thread.</p>

<p>If the reason is fear of disclosing NDA stuff - no AV can possibly prevent me from doing it if I set my mind to it.</p>

<p>If the reason is fear of losing source code and/or documentation - there are distributed revision systems for this (there are at least 20 copies of our repo and we sync on daily basis).</p>

<p>If the reason if fear of disclosing customer data - developers rarely work connected to real production databases, instead they are playing around in toy environments.</p>

<p>Even if there are meaningful arguments in favor of having AV on development machines, they fall apart when faced with the ability to run a Virtual Machine in your paranoidly protected environment.</p>

<p>Since I want to keep an open mind of the issue, could anyone present meaningful, strong argument in favor of Anti-virus software for developers?</p>

<p>It starts with the Global Accelerator, goes through VPN to Load Balancer to Subnet to Instance basically. But some stuff feels a bit redundant and I'm not sure if I'm using things entirely correctly yet. Here is the recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Global Accelerator for the world.</li>
<li>1 Global Accelerator Listener for the different internet ports your application works under. (HTTP 80, HTTPS 443 by convention).</li>
<li>1 Global Accelerator Endpoint Group per Global Accelerator Listener.
<ul>
<li>Connect it to each VPC Load Balancer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1 VPN per user. Use this to connect to the network.</li>
<li>1 VPC per region.</li>
<li>Public and Private subnets for each Availability Zone (can subdivide however you like).</li>
<li>1 Application Load Balancer per VPN. <em>Or should it be 1 per Subnet?</em>
<ul>
<li>Connect the 1 Load Balancer to the Public Subnet in each Availability Zone. So 1 Load Balancer spans all Availability Zones.</li>
<li>Connect 1 Security Group to the Load Balancer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1 Security Group per Subnet. This applies to instances in a subnet.</li>
<li>1 Network ACL for each Subnet. This applies to the network as a whole.</li>
<li>1 NAT Gateway per private subnet that connects to the internet (egress). This means 1 NAT Gateway per subnet per availability zone.</li>
<li>1 Internet Gateway per public subnet that connects to the internet (egress). This means 1 Internet Gateway per subnet per availability zone.</li>
<li>1 Route Table for each Subnet.</li>
<li>1 Route for each Route Table for each connection.</li>
<li>1 Network Interface per Instance (can be attached to different instance if one fails).</li>
<li>IAM roles and users play a role on the instance, but I haven't gotten there yet.</li>
<li>Autoscaling groups play a role as well, but haven't gotten there yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>The question I have is:</p>
<ul>
<li>What to do with Elastic IP addresses? They are connected to a Network Interface (and there is 1 Network Interface per Instance). Does that mean each Instance has essentially 1 Elastic IP Address? They are also connected to the NAT Gateway (allocation_id). What does this mean?</li>
<li>What is the order of steps a request goes through? It starts at HTTPS in the browser, then goes to the DNS which somehow goes to the Global Accelerator anycast system. This goes to the Endpoint group configuration (load balancer) that is closest to the request origin. HTTPS is terminated at the load balancer and goes to HTTP internally. The Load Balancer is connected to a Public Subnet, which hahs a security group, NACL, and route table which tells it how to direct traffic to the next layer in the system. <em>Where does the Internet Gateway fit in, specifically with the Load Balancer already handling internet traffic?</em> The HTTP requests then goes to the next subnet, and next subnet, until it reaches the proper subnet based on the target IP. Then it goes to the Network Interface, which does something? Then it goes to the instance.</li>
<li>Is there anything I am missing in this configuration? Anything that can be improved or in which there are clear best practices?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just for making a request. I haven't done Route53 yet, but I think I can figure that part out.</p>

I intend to use a single token to authorise users.

However, I'm a bit shaky on how I should go about it despite looking at several resources detailing security practices and general specifications.</p>
<p>Would it be reasonable to set the authorisation token as a HTTP-only cookie? Of course not the result of OAuth, but a generated one.</p>
<p>If I read Mozilla <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation</a> right, using HTTP-only cookies would allow me to set cookies for individual users, with no way of the websites using the API having access to it.

<p>The only way I see to not introduce security vulnerabilities is to remove the autologin feature and make the user type their password every time they want to use  a service, but that's a usability struggle and users are spoiled to expect not to have to do that.</p>

<p>What can I read about locally storing credentials safely to implement the automatic login feature? If the principles are too simple for an entire article, what are they? The software in question should not depend on features not present on all platforms (like the ""keychain"" some linux distributions have).</p>

<p>While Rails uses a single CSRF token for the entire application (and stores it in a <code>meta</code> tag), Roda recommends using <a href=""https://roda.jeremyevans.net/rdoc/classes/Roda/RodaPlugins/RouteCsrf.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">route-specific CSRF tokens</a>.</p>
<p>So, if I have a table of entities on my index page, and I'd want to edit (and update) some of those entities inside said table, I would naturally need to obtain tokens for each entity (since each of them has their own path).</p>
<p>Currently, I ship the tokens in a field in the JSON api, so it looks a bit like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;createToken&quot;: &quot;D5pnSokPWiutf2X0Z+lCUshSNfJs3Sv+MvNcg8lxmg3Uh5r57I/EX2ObG1aAChVrxXq1/efv61akUsoN9grt&quot;,

        },
        // Omitting more elements
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>But I'm not happy with it. After all, the point of a CSRF token is that it should be hard to obtain for an attacker, but here they can obtain it with just an extra query...</p>
<p>So, is this a good way to serve the entity-specific tokens from backend to frontend? Are there any better ways?</p>

<p>Imagine an authentication system where you're using a JavaScript framework like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backbone.js"">Backbone</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS"">AngularJS</a>, and you need secure endpoints. That's not a problem, as the server always has the last word and will check if you're authorized to do what you want.</p>

<p>But what if you need a little security without involving the server? Is that possible?</p>

<p>For example, say you've got a client-side routing system and you want a concrete route to be protected for logged-in users. So you ping the server asking if you're allowed to visit protected routes and you go on. The problem is that when you ping the server, you store the response in a variable, so the next time you go to a private route, it will check that if you're already logged in (no ping to the server), and depending on the response it will go or not.</p>

<p><strong>How easy is for a user to modify that variable and get access?</strong></p>

<p>My security (and JavaScript) knowledge isn't great. But if a variable is not in global scope and is in the private part of a module pattern which only have getters but not setters, even in that case, can you hack the thing out?</p>

I am also extremely familiar with openssl command line tools.</p>

<h2>The requirements</h2>

<p>(This is a learning project - This is never going to be used in a bank)</p>

<p>This is the website for a bank. All Internet Banking users are allowed use any signing certificate issued by a few known CAs (verisign, Thawte, entrust etc). The Bank is not responsible for procuring certificates for the user. The user logs into the bank site with his userid/password etc. He has access to most parts of his account. However, when the user wants to do a transaction - like transferring money to different account - the bank wants him to sign the transaction with a certificate.</p>

<h2>The design</h2>

<p>When user choses ""Transfer"" option - the website throws up a form where there are 3 entries - ""Transfer To"" account, the Amount of the transaction and a way for chosing a cert for doing the digital signing &amp; do the signing.</p>

<p>I concatenate the ""Transfer To"" Account no &amp; the amount plus a nonce and this is the string which will be signed and sent to the backend.</p>

<p>I have searched a lot but haven't been able to figure out how to achieve 
- letting the user chose a cert
- do the signing.</p>

<p>I know how the user can add certs to his personal truststore on Windows. But how would I ask the browser to show him certs to chose from?</p>

<p>How does the signing get done - I really don't want to write crypto code in Javascript!!! So is the alternative having an ActiveX or a Java Applet? Is there a better way? Is there a way to ask the browser to use the cert and do the signing?</p>

<p>I have not decided on a platform/framework/language for now - so this question is rather generic.</p>

<p>I have searched a lot for this kind of info without luck - all I get is tutorials on digital signing, tutorials on how to enable PKI in Apache etc.</p>

<p>If someone feels my whole approach is wrong &amp; there is a better way to do digital signing in a web-app - feel free to suggest those alternatives also.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I saw that Apache has a way to enable 2 way ssl - in this case, i think navigating to the website would automatically ask for a cert from the user. But I am not sure if this is enough because it seems that all it verifies is whether a certificate is signed by a trusted CA &amp; also may be whether it falls in a white list of subject lines of the certificates etc. But this is not enough for a bank case because you need to be able to associate a bankuserid with a certificate.</p></li>
<li><p>IIS seems to have a way by which I can have a certificate stored for each user in Active Directory. This is what I understood from reading few MSDN articles. You turn on 2 way SSL in IIS &amp; then when the user tries to navigate to the website, IIS will send a request to the browser with a list of approved CAs and browser will let the user pick an appropriate certificate from his certstore and sends it to backend. I am assuming that IIS will do 2 things</p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure that the user has the private key corresponding to the cert (by under the cover negotiations)</li>
<li>Based on the AD User-Cert Mapping, IIS will report the username to the application.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Do the authentication explicity by calling crypto functions rather depending on depending on the webserver to do it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Show a user screen where he uploads a certificate and the application ensures the user has the private key corresponding to the cert (by asking the front-end to sign some string using the cert).</li>
<li>The application has a database some of data is stored which allows each user to be mapped to his userid. This may be </li>
<li>the whole cert corresponding to each userid</li>
<li>the CA and cert serial number corresponding to each user id.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><p>Storing it on clients' web storage: I don't think this can be an answer since the <code>Web Server</code> shouldn't able to get clients' web storage data. this means SSR (server-side rendering) wouldn't work well.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Storing it on <code>Cookie</code>: this is bad too. because we send a signing in request to the <code>API Server</code> that will be on different container (or server) and domain. we cannot set cookies <strong>from</strong> different domain with proper way. and if we get token and store it cookies directly from client side (setting cookie from javascript), It will be really huge security issue since attackers can take users' token with XSS.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using <code>Cookie</code> but set from other subdomains with specifying <code>Domain</code>: we can specify domain for setting cookie. as far as I know, a response from <code>api.example.com</code> can set cookies for <code>example.com</code> with specifying <code>Domain</code> property of <code>Set-Cookies</code> value. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18492576/share-cookie-between-subdomain-and-domain#:%7E:text=The%202%20domains%20mydomain.com,%22host%2Donly%20cookie%22."">read this</a></p>

<p>yeah, method 3 seems pretty neat to have but I absolutely don't know that setting cookies from another sub-domains will cause big security hole. my web service will process about users' money so security issues will come very critical.</p>
<p>someone I know advised me that I can use reverse proxy with <strong>paths</strong> not domain. I mean, if <code>API Server</code> was serving on <code>api.example.com</code>, we can serve it on <code>example.com/api/*</code> so now we can share the cookies between all the server and client. but we should store cookies on web storage too since cookies will be flagged as <code>HttpOnly</code>. this will cause increasing complexity of development.</p>

<p>Does <em>not signing</em> the ClickOnce manifest constitute an unsigned manifest (as per MSDN's definition)? The application manifest contains a hash of the files in the deployment package. Any changes to the files within it results in a validation failure during installation. Does this negate the above security risks, at all?</p>

<p>In the book, there is an example of implementing a simple shell, which calls <code>strcpy()</code>. I was wondering what purpose is <code>strcpy(buf, cmdline)</code> in <code>eval()</code>?

<p>Now let's say that there is a business requirement which stipulates that a user is not allowed to reuse a previous password. </p>

<p>In 1, it is ok to return a ""You cannot reuse a previous password"" message, providing the user has successfully authenticated themselves with their current password.</p>

<p>In 2, I need to prevent information leakage. The administrator should not be given information on a user's previous password.

<p>Is there any way around this or am I just being too fastidious? My first thought is that the solution is to remove 2, and add a Reset Password feature.</p>

<p>EDIT - I think there is a bit of misunderstanding of the problem. The problem is that the user may have used one of their previous passwords on another site (eg: Bank). Thinking a bit more about this, I'm not sure how much more problematic the ""changing another users password"" leakage source is than someone simply trying to brute-forcing the main login form...</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this is the right site as this question sits under both software engineering and security domains.</p>
<h2>Background:</h2>
<p>Assume you have a financial web application that receives sensitive requests from its users (e.g. money transfers) and you want your application to be able to process sensitive operations only if they were originated by the client. Your application also has a &quot;back-office&quot; interface, which allows specific employees to perform bulk operations such as a promotional giveaway.</p>
<p>Your architecture is based on micro-services with loosely coupled design principles in mind, hosted on a public cloud (e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure).
Some of the services are frontends, some are backends.
The communication method is varied, some utilize REST, some utilize message queues.</p>
<p>You decide you want to embrace the defense-in-depth approach by applying multiple trust boundaries instead of a single perimeter to avoid a security single point of failure (having one of the services breached to bypass all security boundaries inside the network). With that approach, each service authenticates its consumers, checks their authorization scope, validates their supplied input, and so forth.</p>
<h2>The actual question:</h2>
<p>How can a complete backend service be sure that a request, along with its data was initiated by a client, while not having an increased coupling/being as agnostic as possible between the service and the client?</p>
<p>Alternatively, how trust can be achieved between the service and its consumer?</p>
<h2>Things I have considered so far:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Client-side Digital Signature: the client digitally signs the payload, where the private key is only known to the client. The service can verify the integrity of the message before execution (signed message is passed the whole way)
<ul>
<li>Pros:
<ul>
<li>Provides the highest degree of data integrity and non-repudiation</li>
<li>Backend service can be designed in a way of message validation, which is <em>relatively</em> not that coupled (request can be either signed by a customer, or by the back-office interface operator)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons:
<ul>
<li>Key management on the client-side has many problems</li>
<li>The backend service would still need to map the verification key to the request initiator</li>
<li>Cannot support bulk operations unless requests are stacked along with their signatures (increases used storage)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Side-channel Verification: before final execution, a separated channel reaches to the client to confirm the details of the transaction
<ul>
<li>Pros:
<ul>
<li>Adds a service that handles just that without a significant modification of code on the rest of the services</li>
<li>Avoids having key materials stored on the client-side</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons:
<ul>
<li>Requires an additional &quot;moving part&quot; that might break the system if malfunctioned</li>
<li>Does not provide non-repudiation</li>
<li>Friction with the client as she needs to be available to confirm the operation twice</li>
<li>If the client is not available it would not be possible to process the request</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>A situation was just presented to me that I realize I have never thought about dealing with before, but absolutely <em>should</em> have. I believe OWASP refers to this problem as <strong>Broken Access Control</strong>, but the scenario is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>User X should not be allowed to read/write certain data belonging to User Y.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So for instance, User X is a valid, authenticated user/principal in my system; and so is User Y.</p>
<p>Each user in the system has a &quot;public profile&quot; which consists of, say, 20+ tidbits of information about them that is safe to be shared with all other authenticated users. Things like: username, last login time, length of time they've been a user, their favorite food, etc.</p>
<p>However, certain information, such as their email, payment info, password, and perhaps other sensitive information should only be visible to the user for whom the information belongs to, and only on the appropriate screens, when they are logged in. Furthermore, no one other than them should <em>ever</em> be able to write new values for those pieces of data. So User X should never be able to update User Y's email or password, etc.</p>
<p>Let's say I have RESTful endpoints that allow users to fetch + update their data. So you might have:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>GET /users/{userId}/profile</code> : returns a JSON object with all their shareable &quot;public&quot; data</li>
<li><code>PUT /users/{userId}/email</code> : updates a user's email address with a new value</li>
</ul>
<p>In the latter case, we need to restrict access to the endpoint in such a way that the requester can only be permitted to take the action if its for their own <code>userId</code>.</p>
<p><strong>I'm wondering what the typical solution is for such a scenario?</strong></p>
<p>Assume a JWT-based authentication mechanism where the user logs in, the backend generates a JWT for them, and they can then make calls to authenticated URLs using those JWTs. The JWTs can contain whatever claims they need in order to make the solution work!</p>

Basically my highest priority requirement is security and very long term lifetime.</p>
<p>My current situation is having to maintain 15 year-ish old web application written in PHP5 (at the time, it was a cutting edge application since <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP#cite_ref-about_PHP_9-5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PHP5 released at July 2004</a>. The application used custom, closed-source framework (since I imagine at that time there's yet any popular or mature frameworks yet)</p>
<p>The application have served the organization for long time, and it's rather business critical. I'm trying to make a new mobile friendly version of it (to run alongside the old one). Should I use the same framework, or should I use newer frameworks like symfony or laravel?</p>
<p>[A] When I read the source code of the old framework, I realized that there's a lot of demerit:</p>
<ul>
<li>a lot of it didn't follow some of OWASP best practices (I can't say which ones);</li>
<li>no automated test, no documentation (every time we need to change something, we're reverse engineering it and hope things didn't break);</li>
<li>a lot of bad PHP programming practice in general (variable name upper\lower-casing, drowning in warnings, gigantic monolith, no null safety, very loosely typed, no error logging, not using abstraction layer, basically going against every PSR that exist out there)</li>
<li>basically a very huge technical debt</li>
</ul>
<p>[B] Even so, the consideration of keep using our old, custom, closed-source framework is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>it's more secure
<ul>
<li>security through obscurity (only us know the source code, unlike open source frameworks which their code are basically 'leaked' through the internet),</li>
<li>AND security through very strict network firewall rules,</li>
<li>AND security through enforced legal and organizational law);</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>more understandable by the team (us);</li>
<li>PHP5 will still run on servers;</li>
<li>it's lifetime is forever (since the team: us; still maintain it and patch security vulnerabilities), - it will never get deprecated, never get breaking changes; I know that symfony provide LTS release that receive maintenance for 4 years. But it's still very-very short in term of the application's lifetime (our team expect 20-50 year);</li>
<li>it's receiving very huge amount of request every day, no framework (less footprint/resource usage);
even if I try to change to new framework and follow every best practice out there, it'll be bad practices again after 20-50 year</li>
<li>our requirements doesn't mind if the app appears old (in html/css presentation); that's not where our customer find us</li>
</ul>
<p>My question is:</p>
<ul>
<li>should I propose for a change of framework and design?</li>
<li>is there any of my point in [A] or [B] that is wrong or misguided?</li>

"321988","1","","","2016-06-12 02:09:05","","3","3066","<p>I'm designing a RESTful API for my organization. We do use password-based authentication, which generates tokens. One part of our API requires that the users be physically in the office, i.e. there is no use case where someone would need to be using those particular endpoints while working remotely. (It has to do with a physical check-in card-scanning scenario.) </p>

<p>We're writing the REST API in ASP Web API, so my first inclination was simply to check the Request object to see what the remote IP address is, and only allow access to the given resource if that IP address falls within a whitelist. (For those calls which should be restricted)</p>

<p>My co-worker, however, believes this to be insecure. He believes there are ways to abuse HTTP in such a way that a malicious client could cause ASP.NET to report the incorrect remote IP address; therefore, he feels as long as someone knows the valid range of addresses (e.g. a worker could simply ""ipconfig"" on their machine while in the office to determine a valid IP), that person could abuse the API and access it from anywhere.</p>

<p>He suggests, instead, depending solely on a client secret. We're already using password authentication, so that's not the issue. What I'm not sure of is how we'd implement a client secret in such a way that 1. it could not be copied from one machine to another, and 2. that it couldn't be accidentally removed. Obviously anything client-side would be in JavaScript so the ""dev tools"" console is the equivalent of a disassembler.</p>

<p>I have to feel that a combination of the two methods is at least a start - perhaps make the client secret involve the IP address in question, and then have the remote API check the client secret against the IP that the request appears to be coming from. (However, if a user can somehow copy the client secret, that won't help anyway since they could just combine both hacking methods...) This also still does not answer how we would ""pre-install"" a client secret into the client. If we had the REST API provide a secret for later use, you're back where you started - a malicious hacker could (apparently) spoof their IP and retrieve a secret they're not supposed to have.</p>

<p>My understanding of TCP/IP tells me that it's not possible to spoof your source IP address to anything you want and obtain a successful TCP connection. Since we're using a whitelist, someone would have to somehow be able to spoof their IP from the outside to appear to be on our network and engage in a full TCP connection to the HTTP server. I don't even think this is possible, but my co-worker still believes there's a way to abuse the IP whitelist. </p>

<p>Which one of us is right? Or are neither of us right at all and there's a completely different and better approach?</p>

<p>I have below scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relational MySQL Database with <code>BIGINT</code> primary keys and foreign keys</li>
<li>Spring boot as a backend (technology doesn't matter here)</li>
<li>Angular as a frontend (again technology doesn't matter)</li>
</ul>
<p>This system is a large system and there are many intermingled modules with foreign key references, lookup tables, etc. and all the users must be authenticated (we have Spring Security OAuth) to access this system. So from authentication view-point, we are safe. Also we are managing roles and permissions for user's actions (they are mostly used on UI to hide/show menus, buttons, and actions). Everything good so far. The real challenge arises here - lets say there is some ABC module, and authenticated user X is accessing its information using REST call <code>/api/abc/1</code>, here <code>1</code> is the primary key of ABC, and ABC data with key <code>1</code> belongs to X only. But as you can see here, changing the <code>id</code> in above URL, user can access ABC module data of other users too. So how can these actions be authorized?</p>
<p>Below are the points of my research, but none of them seem viable:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Use UUID instead of Int primary keys.</strong></em> But there are drawbacks of UUIds that they increases the database size and they are also guessable at some point by bots.</li>
<li><em><strong>Do not expose the primary keys.</strong></em> But this case will not work in my scenario, as I told that there are many intermingled modules with many references. And in many of the modules, primary keys are the one which are unique.</li>
<li><em><strong>Intercept every REST call, and check whether the passed <code>id/ids</code> belong to that particular authenticated user.</strong></em> But this solution will also become clumsy after some extends because there are many modules, and it will also increase the number of queries to database.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what is the best way for authorization in this kind of application?</p>

<p>I'm struggle with designing an open-source distributed application architecture. I want to create an application consisting of open source server, client, and provider. Client sends requests to one random provider instance that have list of all instances both client and server, and sends it to one of the random server, which, after processing the information, sends a result request back to the client. Every part of this distributed app is open-source, so everyone can create their own instance of client, provider, server, and everything seems to be fine, but what if some programmers will have bad intentions, and they will change client code in the way, that it will send millions of requests (DoS attack) to the specific, not random provider, or change providers with, so it will send all requests to one specific server? Also they can change server code, so if client expects to get a specific picture from server database, hacker will send some inappropriate pictures to all avaible clients.</p>
<p>If I hardcode some kind of verification, like hashing of important functions of API, then hacker will just remove this in his own fork. Therefore, I cannot solve this problem in any way, except by making the code of one of the parts private. For example I can make provider application with private code, so it will check hash of both client and server, and if this check fails - provider will delete this instance from list of instances. This solution sounds good, but in this case, the whole project will no longer be open source.</p>
<p>Summarize: I want to create an open source distributed application, so everyone can make their own instance, improve it, add new functionality, but how can I secure it, so this ability to create custom versions should not be misused for DoS, sniffing, or information corruption in conjunction with all many different versions working together.</p>

<p>We have a database system running on a central server. The latest addition to the system is a bunch of mobile barcode scanners running Android. We are creating a specific app and the devices will be completely locked down so the user may only interact with this app (so no access to any settings).</p>

<p>Overall it's very simple, the devices will connect using an ethernet dock and download a list of items to move along with their destinations. The user scans the items at the destination and collects a signature for delivery. Once connected to the dock, the location of any delivered items will be updated, along with the signature and timestamp of the move.</p>

<p>The plan was that the app would set the device clock from the server time whenever it was connected to the dock. Unfortunately, Android does not allow apps to set the time (the <code>SET_TIME</code> permission is only allowed for system apps). Additionally, the network is incredibly locked down, so we can't rely on the built-in synchronisation, and the devices only have a network connection when docked in the ethernet cradle anyway.</p>

<p>So, given that the devices may have arbitrarily incorrect clocks, is there any way we can correct for this when the data is uploaded? It would be possible to keep a log on the server of the clock for each device whenever it is connected.</p>

<p>In many ways this problem could apply to any offline-capable application. What do you do with time-related data from a device with an unreliable or untrusted clock?</p>

<p>It's not too difficult to correct a consistently-incorrect time, but it seems completely impossible if you consider that the device may lose time completely if the battery goes flat. A similar problem arises for an untrusted device - if the user may change the clock arbitrarily.</p>

<p>Has any research been done on this problem?</p>

<p>Some of the policies have a model-level scope that could be defined like so :</p>
<pre><code>UserGroup x EntityType x AccessMode -&gt; Boolean
</code></pre>
<p>Meantime, I want to have finer policies that opperate at data-level, to restrain users to access only specific instances.</p>
<pre><code>UserGroup x Set&lt;EntityType&gt; x AccessMode -&gt; Boolean
</code></pre>
<p>In one case, the policy is defined over a Data Model, in one other over Data.
I'm not especially familiar with security policies, is it a bad design to make cohabit two different kind of policies ? Or is it just a misunderstanding that I have, and they work seamlessly ?</p>
<p><strong>Let's me illustrate this :</strong></p>
<p>For AccessMode we can use a CRUD-based approach.</p>
<p>Read, Update and Delete mode may operate both over entities and specific instances of entities.
We can write a rule that allows all users belonging to a group Group1 to access any Post in Read mode :</p>
<pre><code>Group1 = {User1, User2, ...}
Group1 x Post x Read -&gt; True
</code></pre>
<p>But, we can also restrain this policy to allow access to specific instances of Post like this :</p>
<pre><code>Group2 = {User6, User7, ...}
Group2 x {Post1, Post3, Post4} x Read -&gt; True
</code></pre>
<p>Here, Users of Group2 can read specific posts Post1, Post3 and Post4, but don't have global permissions over the Post entity.</p>
<p>We can also imagine more complex logic like so :</p>
<pre><code>{user in Group1} x {post in Post if post.author = user} x Write -&gt; True
</code></pre>
<p>Here, users that are allowed to write posts are users that belong to Group1 and that are specifically the author of the post.</p>
<p>Being able to have access control at data-level is important.
But there's at least one case which requires to deal with entity-level policy, which is the Create mode since it defines whether the users may instanciate an entity type and has nothing to do with existing data.</p>
<p>In this case (but could also apply to other access modes) :</p>
<pre><code>Group1 = {User1, User2, ...}
Group1 x Post x Create -&gt; True
</code></pre>
<p><code>Post</code> refers to the entity type.</p>

<p>The main issue they have is that user authentication takes place on the client, rather than the server. The reason being that an attacker could decompile our (C#) application and build a modified version which could allow any password to be accepted.</p>
<p>The problem is, a requirement from our customer is that the application needs to work offline, so some sort of authentication will need to be done by the application without communicating with the server.</p>
<p>The pen testers suggested using a token system where the user authenticates with the server and it stores a token in the local database which would be used while offline, but I don't see how this solves the decompiling issue. Surely this could be bypassed in the same way?</p>
<p>Is my only option to tell the customer that if they want the application to be secure, then it can't work offline?</p>
<p>-- additional details</p>
<p>There isn't an &quot;offline-mode&quot; as such, just when an Internet connection is not available (several of the users might take a laptop to farms, for example), so authenticating with a server isn't possible. Admittedly, this isn't as much of an issue as it used to be, with 4G/5G availability.</p>
<p>On first login, after the initial authentication with the server, settings/config data is downloaded and stored in a local database (MSSQL or SQLite). Logging in while offline would allow access this data (so the program can function) and data the user has entered/saved.</p>
<p>The program has to &quot;phone home&quot; occasionally already (the settings expire after a week of no contact with the server), but I can't see how to stop a user from logging into the program if it is decompiled. If it downloads a token from the server, checking this could be bypassed in the same way entering a password could be.</p>
<p>I guess this question boils down to &quot;is it possible to prevent an attacker decompiling my program to circumvent authentication without requiring a server?&quot;. So far the only option seems to be to use the user's password as a key to encrypt the data, but then if (when!) the user forgets their password, the data is lost.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Chief Financial Officer or someone like that would be the only with the keys, with some type of backup.  The data is done in a way very similar to how an individual would do it.</li>
<li>The Information Technology (I.T.) may be called upon.  For example, they might write a bot to buy the cryptos at certain prices or criteria.</li>
</ol>
<p>If I.T. is involved, then one or more programmers or I.T. staff would have access to the keys. If they weren't honest, or left the company, they could use the keys to transfer out all the cryptos.  Even if I.T. created an application for the company, the &quot;bad people&quot; could simply do a transfer using the private key totally outside the company's network.</p>
<p>I was thinking that one approach might be to have some automated software to keep moving the cryptos around to new accounts every x hours. To do this, the private/public key would have to be generated by software, but still stored in a data store of some type.  Maybe that would have to be a separate database instance that only very key people had the access codes to.</p>

I would like to know if there are downsides or security risks with an authentication implementation.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm storing a JWT in an HTTP only cookie to send it from the client (React application) to the server (Spring Boot/Kotlin application). This removes the XSS vulnerability.</p>
<p>The JWT follows the basic principles (encoded secret, expiration date, issuer check, etc.). The server has servlet filters that check an existing cookie for validity on every request. When signing in via the client, the server responds with a valid JWT:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0GAlG.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0GAlG.png"" alt=""sign in"" /></a></p>
<p>The client will send its cookie with every request, which is furthermore checked for validity by the server's servlet filters on every request. When these checks are positive, the user is authenticated with Spring Security.</p>
<p>As described above, the JWT expires after 1 hour, 1 day, or whatever is configured. That's why I need to refresh it some way or another. Now, instead of using a refresh token and placing it in the client's local storage, I decided to just make a small request to the server and create a new JWT, which is send back via the response again:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SJv0n.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SJv0n.png"" alt=""refresh"" /></a></p>
<p>Again, when the <code>refresh</code> endpoint is called, the servlet filters will check for validity. So only an already authenticated user will receive a new JWT token that way. Some invalid JWT will not receive a new JWT.
I'm calling this endpoint from the client in an interval and therefore regularly extend the expiration date of the JWT inside the cookie.</p>
<hr />
<p>What I'm aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>With the current refresh mechanism, an access token can be valid indefinitely (when the user is signed in regularly).</li>
<li>I also don't persist valid tokens or sessions in the database, so I can't really invalidate specific user sessions &quot;globally&quot; that way, as the cookie is the only source of truth. But this has nothing to do with the refresh token, I could create such whitelist/blacklist via the user ID instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>If something really bad happens, I could still</p>
<ul>
<li>...change the expiration date of all JWT to 0, so every authenticated user will be unauthenticated the next time he sends a request.</li>
<li>...or I could change the JWT secret, from which one no request will be authenticated anymore.</li>
</ul>
<p>My question is: Has what I'm doing (replacing the JWT inside the cookie) any more downsides?</p>

"429672","1","","","2021-06-24 11:29:37","","1","416","<p>We are currently in the early phases of developing several applications that differ significantly in their functionality. As part of building these applications, we have also developed a few generic BCs. Ideally these BCs should be reusable in order to minimize duplication and remove cross cutting conerns, and further improve development of future applications. Among these are a generic BC used to handle notifications such as emails, a BC dedicated to activity feeds, and more--and even more in the future.</p>
<p>This all works well and nicely in terms of the functionality they implement. However, I am unsure as to how to handle authorization and filtering of data in the case of either querying or executing commands.</p>
<p>Essentially, the source of truth with respect to the authorization rules are the non-generic applications/BCs. These applications can be totally different, but they all require authorization and the use of zero or more of the aforementioned generic BCs. Now, comes the question: What is the best way to handle this cross cutting concern without having to duplicate authorization logic for each new application we develop?</p>
<p>Our plan was originally to have a generic BC for Security that stores information about the resources and subjects that are in the system. In order to enforce the authorization, we envisioned developing an API-gateway for each non-generic application we develop and have the API-gateway enforce security policies. This approach should work well for handling authorization of command.</p>
<p>However, for queries, things seem to be complicated. For instance, our activity feeds may contain records that only a subset of the users of some application should be able to see, based on their roles in that specific application. In addition, some users may be able to only access a subset of the information of the returned records. For instance when fetching information from the generic BC that handles a Filesystem, some documents should be visible to some, while hidden from others.</p>
<p>Would filtering the information provided by the generic BC in the API-gateway before returning the data be a viable solutions? For instance when a given user fetches an activity feed from the Activity BC, the API-gateway queries the Security BC for information required to filter the results. This would incur overhead by having unnecessary data returned from the generic BC (i.e. the records/fields that are removed after filtering), but on the other hand this greatly reduces the complexity that filtering within that BC itself would incur. To me it seems that there should be a better approach without polluting each and every generic BC with authorization logic.</p>
<p>I have also read about the <strong>sidecar pattern</strong>. Would it make sense that each service implementing a generic BC has a sidecar containing the generic Security/Authorization BC? In order to avoid polluting each QueryHandler with authorisation filtering, the query result could e.g. be passed through a filter that interacts with the sidecar.</p>
<p>I am sorry for the long post; I hope I articulated myself in an understandable way. The approach to solving cross cutting concerns in DDD (and microservices) seem to be a highly debated topic, and it can be overwhelming to interpret the massive amounts of opinions regarding this.</p>

<p>So, my question is, should I separate the new requirements into another publicly accessible application separate from the original application that requires user authentication? The app currently sits on an angular/.Net/MSSQL stack so this could require duplicating all or some portions of the stack. What are the things to consider in regards to one app with both public and private access vs two apps, one for the public and one used internally?</p>

We have concluded that the only way this could work, is if our clients can install an agent in their network, that would gather the required information and push it to our system through the internet.</p>
<p>This agent application, cannot communicate to our server using a regular RestAPI or webservice, because we have use cases that require us requesting specific information to the specific agent instances (a request to resync data from client 1 should only go to client 1's agent). We looked into gRPC streams and keep a stream open with every agent and just routes those requests to the stream, but since our backend has multiple instances, it would be hard to identify and reuse a single stream from different instances.</p>
<p>Then something that works for us, is using Redis streams and create a stream per agent, then our backend would only have to write to the specific agent redis stream (it would know the name of the stream as it would the agent/client identifier) from whichever of our instances.</p>
<p>The concern though, is the &quot;over the internet&quot; part.</p>
<p>Redis has TLS support since version 6, allows us to block certain commands (flushall for example) and supports defining users with access to only specific commands and keys/streams...</p>
<p>I understand exposing Redis over the internet or to any other network that not the one serving redis itself, has always been discouraged (AWS ElastiCache only allows access from within the same VPC/subnet for example). However, everything I find about redis security, say something in the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not publicly expose the Redis server
Since Redis has no default authentication, it does not support encryption. All data is stored in cleartext. An attacker can use FLUSHALL command to delete all key-value data sets...
<a href=""https://www.gspann.com/resources/blogs/best-practices-to-secure-redis-implementation-in-cloud-infrastructure/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That type of statement holds very true to older versions of Redis that didn't provide TLS nor access control. But since those are now supported since version 6, am I crazy to go forward with this?</p>
<p>There's a concern about rate limiting, which is probably something that is not addressed by Redis itself, but that we can possibly find a solution with Kubernetes or network configuration in the cloud.</p>
<p>So, I know this is an unusual architecture and I am not the only one to <a href=""https://medium.com/@treeder/exposing-messaging-internals-to-the-outside-world-9eb8a9b886aa"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">think about it</a>, but  I am just looking for your opinions on whether exposing Redis streams over the internet for my use case, considering the features that Redis now has, is that much of a security risk/ bad idea overall.</p>

The app is made to be used by different users on the same machine.</p>
<p>The app the communicating directly with the database, authentication and permissions are handled by the app against the database, only the database settings and a hashed master password to change them are kept locally (using <code>QSettings</code>) and set by the IT of the company (currently me) not the user himself. Now I’m wondering how to “user proof” that.</p>
<p>Ultimately, a user can open the settings and directly communicate with the database to change values. Encrypting the values would help but it wouldn’t be “secured” as I would either have to store the encryption key in the settings, or hard code it in the app. Some malicious users will try to break the app, to change the stocks values or to make an invoice disappear (that’s why they are doing with our old system, hidden by frequent malfunctions, so no ultimate proof, that’s why I’m recording something from scratch) but it’s also very unlikely our users have the skills to disassemble and find the KDF algorithm or the hard coded passphrase. I can’t tie the passphrase to a user’s desktop session or login, as multiple users can use the same machine.</p>

<p>I understand that with <strong>SRI</strong>, once you've added a script reference with the correct <code>integrity</code> attribute, if the remote script is subsequently compromised, then the <strong>SRI Hash</strong> will not match the remote asset and the remote script will not download.</p>
<p>That's an effective safeguard as long as the remote script was uncompromised at the point when you first referenced it.</p>
<p>But what if, at that point, the remote script was <em>already</em> compromised (and a new SRIHash generated to match the compromised asset)?</p>
<p>The asset must be able to self-verify. My principle concern here is <strong>self-verification</strong>.</p>
<p>That is, an asset needs to be able to authenticate itself in the absence of third-party verification.</p>
<p>(An SRIHash will verify that the asset is a data-match, but that doesn't help if a bad actor is able to alter both the asset <em>and</em> the SRI Hash.)</p>
<p>At the very least, we need <em>more</em> than just an SRIHash.</p>
<p>To verify the integrity of a new unknown remote asset from a new unknown source, when we cannot say for certain if either the remote asset or the remote source has not been compromised, we need something that <em>cannot be plausibly altered</em> without giving the game away.</p>
<p>Can this be achieved (?) by adding to the asset and the SRIHash the combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>timestamp</strong></li>
<li>a <strong>geostamp</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>N.B.</strong> I'm specifically talking about a <em>legitimate asset</em> which has been compromised, <em>not</em> a <em>bad asset</em> which was bad from the outset. I
recognise there's nothing that can be done about the latter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what I've come up with so far in terms of an unknown remote asset self-verifying its integrity:</p>
<p>The remote asset has a conventional <strong>SRI Hash</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>the asset has a name and a version</li>
<li>the named, versioned asset contains a <strong>Unix Timestamp</strong> giving the time it was first published</li>
<li>the named, versioned asset contains <strong>Lat and Long Geo-coordinates</strong> giving the location it was first published</li>
</ol>
<p>The three pieces of data above are used to derive from the <strong>SRI Hash</strong>:</p>
<ol start=""4"">
<li>a 256-character key.</li>
</ol>
<p>That 256-character key is then used to derive from the asset itself:</p>
<ol start=""5"">
<li>a 16-character slug</li>
</ol>
<p>That 16-character slug is then inserted into the named, versioned filename and becomes a <strong>canonical part</strong> of that filename:</p>
<pre><code>https://example.com/remote-folder/remote-script--2-4--39dsoe26shw82czm.js
</code></pre>
<p>Wherever <strong>Remote Script 2.4</strong> is hosted on the web, it will always have the filename:</p>
<pre><code>remote-script--2-4--39dsoe26shw82czm.js
</code></pre>
<p>Nearly all pieces of information (the SRIHash, the timestamp, the geo-coordinates, the 16-character slug) are referenced in the data itself so that everything can either:</p>
<p>i) be checked as identical by the computer (eg. Is the SRIHash in the attribute the same as the one listed in the asset? Does the filename duplicate the same 16-character sequence from the asset? Is the Asset Name the same as listed? Is the Asset Version the same as listed?); or else</p>
<p>ii) the technician referencing the remote script can be asked if they trust the asset's signature (eg, This data reports that it was published [in the middle of the Pacific] in 1981? Do you wish to continue?)</p>
<p>It occurs to me that a determined exploiter who wants to generate a 256-character key for their own compromised version, where the key is consistent with a <em>plausible publishing time and location</em> will need to manipulate the asset itself by inserting comments. Consequently a semi-automated check would <em>also</em> be required to verify that the asset doesn't contain any unusual comments.</p>
<p>Is this level of self-verification of integrity (using a <strong>timestamp</strong> and a <strong>geostamp</strong>) enough? Or is this too easily circumvented?</p>
<p>This is mostly as far as I've got on my own, but I'm happy to answer any further questions to clarify any detail I may have inadvertently left out.</p>

My teammate wants to store user data in Vault by using Postgres user row id as the key in Vault while I think it's better to store by unique user identifier as the key.</p>
<p>The disadvantages of using Postgres id's is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vault is tightly coupled with Postgres</li>
<li>When I use local DB for development the ids might be different so I will also have to use a local instance of Vault for development instead of using a staging Vault instance</li>
<li>I can't think of an exact example but I think using Postgres id's can somehow become inconsistent with Vault id's (maybe when a transaction fails but Vault is updated with a new user id which will become a &quot;zombie&quot; key).</li>
</ul>
<p>The advantages of using Postgres id's is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vault keys don't contain unique user identifier which makes them more secure</li>
</ul>
<p>Which approach is better?</p>

<p>The sections below elaborate a bit more on the subject and specific concerns.</p>
<hr />
<p>When setting up a Javascript/Typescript tool chain to develop a Web application using, for example, <code>webpack</code>, React and Jest, then you may be able to select a few &quot;must have&quot; and a few &quot;wanted&quot; NPM top level packages. But even when these are carefully chosen, there will usually be hundreds if not thousands of secondary, tertiary, etc., dependencies dragged in that fall outside of the &quot;carefully chosen&quot; realm and it is impossible to keep track of security and quality for all of them.</p>
<p>An <code>npm audit</code> will show vulnerabilities and it may be possible to get these to zero at least for the production code. But often interdependencies prevent an outright update of all packages, even when prepared to adapt for breaking changes. That means that, at least for the dev dependencies, vulnerabilities may remain and each vulnerability should be carefully considered before allowing development to continue. This could become a time consuming task as changes can be frequent.</p>
<p>I'm aware that there are commercial offerings that may assist in managing vulnerabilities but I have no experience with those.</p>
<p>Within the current software landscape of 2022, and with cybersecurity on everybody's mind:</p>
<p>If you are developing web applications commercially using NPM packages, what do you do to reduce risks?</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<p>How do you setup your tool chain and manage the development cycle securely in a commercial setting where there are constraints on time and money?</p>
<hr />
<p>Following the comment by @Flater, I'd like to elaborate on what I consider 'risks'.</p>
<p>My concern would not be breaking the build or breaking functionality due to altered behavior (i.e. unintended bugs in the package). The former is obvious and the latter should be caught during product testing.</p>
<p>Firstly, there is a risk of infecting the developer machine with malware; this could be ransomware or some other destructive software, i.e. software that deletes files randomly and spreads across the network. Would you install each NPM update onto an isolated machine and observe for x hours or x days before the update can be considered secure for deployment on developer machines? That's probably not workable. Use some third party tool that must flag the NPM package as secure? Which tool and how would that work? Update first onto a virtual machine then run the tool for a scan? Or trust that someone else would have discovered any misbehavior of NPM packages and simply run the update? Any other approach?</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the risk of delivering malware to the customer, i.e. hidden bitcoin miners, adware, spyware, possibly even Web apps that attempt to exploit browser vulnerabilities. Do you monitor the Web app for a while as part of the testing regime, for example running in the browser while monitoring network activity or looking out for &quot;unusual behavior&quot;? Do you monitor browser CPU usage as part of your testing?</p>
<p>Thirdly, less severe, there may be unwanted 'pings' (i.e. downloading an icon via CDN rather than locally) or other 'phoning home' incidents (i.e. usage monitoring) originating from packages that you may otherwise consider trustworthy. These could be something simply forgotten by the author or it is documented &quot;somewhere&quot; that this is expected behavior unless this or that configuration parameter is set. Web apps that are deployed onto Intranets of security conscious customers would question these incidents flagged by their firewalls. Although this may not turn out to be a security risk per se, random attempts to contact the Internet may be a risk to your reputation. Again, do you monitor network activity in a browser to ensure that no unwanted Internet contact is established? If there is contact from what you consider a trustworthy package, would you halt the release? Or add it to the release notes to explain it away and prepare to answer awkward questions asked by customers? Any other steps taken?</p>
<p>I realize that businesses and budgets for software testing and quality assurance vary greatly. So assuming you are not NASA and must remain competitive, what steps does your business take to minimize the above risks? Is there a &quot;best practice&quot; when it comes to NPM with it's unique authoring and delivery mechanisms, fit for 2022?</p>

<p>Of course, a PKI can be used for authentication and authorization. In this case, however, it is not only important to know from <strong>whom</strong> the data comes, but also that it <strong>has not been changed</strong> from the data provider after a specfic timestamp.</p>
<p>I thought maybe the data provider could hash the recorded data and sign it with his private key. The signatures would now have to be stored in a trusted location. For this, a blockchain came to my mind at first.

[ref_id] --&gt; varchar(36) not null (UUID)

<p>My first thought is that for each user added to the application a secret will need to be created in the SSO user profile, and then sent back each time as one of the identity claims or just be retrieved some other way after login. For AAD I believe this can only be done with an <a href=""https://learningbydoing.cloud/blog/getting-started-with-azuread-extension-attributes/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">extension attribute</a>. There are a few drawbacks to this though, at least with AAD:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>An AAD admin would be required to add each user to the application (even if they were already in AAD), since only the User Administrator role can apparently set extension property values; unless I'm doing something wrong, standard users cannot set extension attribute values on their own profiles. So this precludes the possibility of the customer's users accessing the application without admin intervention for each user.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Customers might not want to give my application the Graph API permission &quot;User.ReadWrite.All&quot; (which, even if under the admin's identity, is needed to write extension properties to the AAD user profiles when they're added to the application). If not, then admins will have to do something like run a Powershell script every time they want to add a user in their Directory to our application; they could not be added purely in-app (even by the admin).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Customers might not want to be adding extension properties to their directories at all. This one seems like a deal breaker.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Another option I've considered that at least avoids (1) and (2) is having one secret for the customer, so that they only have to set up the application once and all users could then access it without admin intervention. Even assuming it were possible to get this information returned with each login, the problem is obvious - if that &quot;secret&quot; were compromised it would compromise the whole organization, not just one user.</p>
<p>Finally I've considered just requiring users, as part of the signup process, to pick a PIN that they have to enter every time they log in, even when using SSO. This rather defeats the purpose of SSO, is not going to be popular, and unless the required PIN is long, really doesn't add that much security.</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest any other, better approaches to this, or let me know if I've missed something or am mistaken about anything above?</p>
<p>Update - I'm thinking of exploring using an Azure KeyVault with RBAC. Each user gets their own secret that only they and admins can access. After sign-in the user's AAD access token (the one I can use to call the Graph API, etc.) would be provided to the backend temporarily to access the Key Vault, which would be firewalled with an IP whitelist. Any feedback on this idea would be appreciated!</p>

Each unique user creates an account and needs to place a tracking script on their website so that their website visitor actions can be tracked. Something like this in the head:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script defer data-domain=&quot;testing.com&quot; src=“url/path/to/my/website/script“&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The script needs to make an API request to send the data to the server for processing. As the script would be on every page of every customers’ sites, there would be a lot of API requests. I worry that if a customer stops paying but leaves the script on their website, it will still make API requests, hence I need a way of rejecting the API requests.</p>
<p>I’ve been reading around and am trying to figure out the best way of preventing unauthorised use of an API. Ideas that have been raised are using an auth token, API key/secret, and throttling/rate limiting, and tracking IDs for convenience. Would using an auth token be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Possible, since assume the user can place their tracking script on their site only once, and JWTs will eventually expire. Would it mean that the script would no longer work? Or could they renew their JWT?</li>
<li>Necessary, and;</li>
<li>Required in order to check whether the customer is still paying and decline the API requests if not?</li>
</ol>
<p>If it is not possible to use an auth token (since it would expire), could the request just use the website URL origin (since each user has a unique website URL), find the user associated with that account, check whether they are a paying customer and decline their API requests accordingly?</p>
<p>Are there any better approaches to this, or any suggestions that anyone has? I wonder what companies like Google etc do.</p>
<p>Presumably even rejecting API requests costs money since my server would have to respond with a 401/403 error, but presumably nothing can be done about this as the script installed on customers’ sites has to have a src attribute that points to the script path on my server. This still concerns me since there could be a large amount of even declined API requests.</p>
<p>FYI, the client-side script uses javascript, my server uses node and GraphQL Apollo server for the API. I would not be able to prevent non-paying customers from removing the tracking script from their websites.</p>

This would mean anyone who visits their site would need to be able to make an API request (without them even necessarily knowing - done via the tracking script) to send the analytics data to the database. E.g. users may install a script in the head like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script data-domain=&quot;somedomain.com&quot; src=&quot;path/to/tracking/script.js?id=SOMETHING&quot; defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

<p>I also wouldn’t want users to have to ever update this script.</p>
<p>My scenario is somewhat similar, but to summarise, I worry that anyone (e.g. a hacker) would be able to insert a load of junk data into the database (since they could make API requests that require no auth).</p>
<p>What could be done to prevent this, but not prevent the script from tracking all users? I was thinking along these lines:</p>
<ol>
<li>IP rate throttling to cap the no. of requests someone can make</li>
<li>Auth tokens send in request headers (but they expire, unless they could be updated automatically some way? From another script? But couldn’t a hacker also access this anyway?)</li>
<li>Ensure that the API endpoint used by the tracking script is designed to only accept requests from the tracking script, and not directly from other sources (e.g. how? via CORS headers?)</li>
</ol>
<p>But presumably authenticating requests is not an option since it would prevent tracking everyone else.</p>
<p>I could be wrong in my assumptions here, but any ideas would be greatly appreciated. It just feels weird, since anyone would be able to insert a load of junk data into the database. It may not be the signed-up user who misuses the API, but instead a random hacker visiting their site</p>

Certain areas of this web application require identification of the user to allow the content to be aligned with the user's capabilities and to prevent user impersonation. The current version is very outdated and uses a very weak username/password-like authentication mechanism, which boils more or less down to unsecured access (abuse has been detected in the past).</p>
<p>I think some kind of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication"" rel=""noreferrer"">MFA</a>, or MFA-based approach is recommended as a replacement for the username/password solution in place. It could be interesting to have an adult, for example, a parent (when used in a home setting) or a teacher (when used at school), confirm access to the online resources on behalf of the user when the user it not able to authenticate for whatever possible reason.</p>
<p>Because some of the users have (very) limited intellectual capabilities, (more) complex mechanisms (like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad"" rel=""noreferrer"">OTP</a>, mobile authenticator, digipass, etc.) are not always suited. Also because of the age range of the target audience (ranging between 8 and 21), we cannot assume every user has access or is allowed to use a smartphone that could be used in the authentication flow. Under such circumstances, parental approval might be a valid alternative solution.</p>
<p>Many possible approaches probably exist to implement such authentication and authorisation solution. Please feel free to share any thoughts/ideas/suggestions to setup such solution.</p>
<p>Currently, a parent or teacher (guardian) registers a child/adolescent (user) via an online registration procedure. This procedure is email based and assigns a username for the user (based on the first name, last name and date of birth), a 3-letter password (limited to the first 10 characters of the alphabet) for the user and a free text guardian password. Using the website, the guardian uses the username/guardian password to add the user account to the local browser (cookie based). When a user want to authenticate, he/she selects his/her picture/avatar and enters the 3-letter password.</p>
<p>My concerns about this approach are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding avatars using a browser cookie to ease future authentication with such a weak password makes authentication pointless.</li>
<li>The very limited number of user password combinations possible with 3 characters out of of a set of 10 possibilities makes it very prone to attacks.</li>
<li>I find the overall procedure somewhat confusing and not very guardian friendly.</li>
</ol>
<p>I deliberately did not explicitly mention before that the current solution is a browser based platform to keep as many possibilities open as possible. Interviewing guardians and users, we noticed a more or less even distribution among the desire for web based solutions and native mobile solutions (the latter does not exist today).</p>

As far as I can tell there are no quantum-safe algorithms yet generally accepted, let alone that are ready to be used in production. (Please correct me if I'm wrong!) Thus I'm assuming I'm still looking at RSA as the gold standard. Estimates for when RSA can be cracked vary from 5 to 15 years or more. 15 years doesn't bother me too much, but 5 years does, especially for a new application.</p>
<p>So, if I'm starting from scratch, what would be considered the best practices to be as prepared as possible for a post-quantum world? And to explain what I mean by prepared, I don't simply mean ready to change algorithms, but rather to best ensure that data transmitted today won't be vulnerable in the future.</p>
<p>Two things I've considered -</p>
<ul>
<li>Using 4096-bit keys. However I don't see a consensus on whether this actually makes much of a difference even for classical attacks, let alone quantum ones.</li>
<li>Keeping public keys effectively private. My idea here is to keep even public keys within the confines of the secure application servers and unavailable to users. We would not allow clients to encrypt or verify sender signatures directly, but rather servers would hold public keys as closely as they hold their other secrets. Encrypting and verifying signatures would thus require client API calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm wondering if these ideas add any genuine security value, or if not why not, and if there are other measures that experts would recommend at this time to architect a new application to be as resilient as possible to the so-called quantum apocalypse.</p>

One alternative is that I don't use links but a small form containg a hidden CSRF token field and a submit button that acts as (and is styled as) a link. The form is sent using a <code>POST</code> request then.

This includes creating a new process to which the current process will connect to via TLS and make requests, so essentially a local server. Except the server can also send requests to the client, and there are also asynchronous notifications being sent.

<p>I am curious to understand more about these topics.

They salt and hash the passwords, but I think that trying to manage security and cryptography themselves is biting off more than they can chew.

I want a modern account system for this app: users log in through OpenID Connect, using either a social login like Facebook or Google or a custom account with us (achieved through the use of an OAuth authorization server like Keycloak deployed alongside the application).</p>
<p>I see two possible ways of achieving this: the SPA/client-side authorization code flow with PKCE or the REST API/server-side traditional authorization code flow. The latter seems like the most secure approach and is supported by Spring Boot's OpenID client library.</p>
<p>However, when using Spring Boot's client library, when the authentication is complete I notice that Spring starts a traditional session. I have the feeling that in modern web applications using stateless bearer token authorization headers is recommended. While traditional sessions can also be very secure and scalable, using bearer tokens does seem much more easy to maintain.</p>
<p>My question is then simply: are Spring Boot's OpenID client's defaults actually sensible? Should I override them and use bearer tokens with my client web app instead of sessions (using HTTP-only cookies or some other mechanism for my SPA to remember the authentication token and emulate sessions securely), should I stick to Spring Boot's strategy of using sessions or should I do something else entirely?</p>
<p>To me Spring Boot's defaults mainly make sense considering traditional Java EE or Spring landscapes, or to easen the migration to OpenID Connect. But I could be wrong. I'd really appreciate your thoughts on the matter.</p>

Now at first glance they improve security by keeping open source dependencies up-to-date. But I am wondering, do the benefits outweigh the risk of a hostile party taking over or sneaking in a seemingly harmless commit, which will then automatically be rolled out via the updater? How quickly such exploits are found depends on the number of users and the activity of the maintainers, so I assume the best trade-off would be to instruct the update-script to wait somewhere between 1-3 months before a version update is applied, no? I am not sure if that actually is possible with most tools, but surely a feature for versions to &quot;mature&quot; before being applied would make sense?</p>

<p>They have a web application that was created by a software company, and they have received the source code of the app.</p>
<p>Years went by, and now they want to refactor their web app, but this time by hiring a full time web developer that takes responsibility of anything regarding the web app.</p>
<p>I just finished the interview and everything went perfect! but here comes the problem ..</p>
<p>They wanted to test my refactoring ability, so they gave me a couple of tasks to refactor. I said that's great, send me a copy of the source code and I'll refactor the web app locally and show you all the updates I can make. but they refused for security reasons, they seem to be afraid that I might steal, hijack, or attack the web app in any shape or form by having a copy of the source code.</p>
<p>They instead wanted me to do a live refactor during an online call by accessing the IT admin's screen using a software and accessing the C panel from his computer and modify the code live inside the C panel.</p>
<p>It was pretty difficult, I explained to the IT admin that this is difficult for a variety of reasons:</p>
<p>1- I'm completely new to the code base, I need sometime to understand what's going on with the code and study it good.</p>
<p>2- Refactoring inside the C panel is difficult, I need a code editor like Visual Studio Code to easily navigate through the project and better understand what is going on.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, he refused, saying that he can't share the source code to a stranger, as I haven't signed a job agreement yet.</p>
<p>I explained to him that it's perfectly normal to share a &quot;COPY&quot; of the source code for a potential hire, as any modifications will only reflect in my local machine, and not the hosted app, they are two separate instances.</p>
<p>I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and I'm not sure how to proceed, so I posted this question here to learn from you experts and those who had a similar experience.</p>

And the simple</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'read in the json and access the property in your build tool'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>got huge number of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'no no no you risk exposing all your dependency versions to the client'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-type responses.</p>
<p>But I'm a bit confused when this relates to open source projects. Isn't the whole code base exposed in the repository? Package.json and all?</p>
<p><em><strong>Also</strong></em>, hasn't there been a huge push lately for - especially enterprise and security-critical software - to make available Software Bills of Materials, so the exact composition of the software is made clear, both to the end user/purchaser and for allowing for automatic checking against any emerging vulnerabilities in its dependencies?</p>
<p>So which is it?</p>
<p>And let's not forget open-source licensing requirements, that sometimes specify that you should include a copy of the dependency's license?</p>
<p>I had built an app that I was going to open source, and I had used some tools to extract out every package dependency:</p>
<ol>
<li>including all transitive dependencies</li>
<li>including all licenses where obtainable, and</li>
<li>the exact dependency version used to compile the app.</li>
</ol>
<p>I was going to make that available to the end user. A kind of SBOM in itself.</p>
<p>I thought this was the right thing to do, but now I'm not so sure. Am I inviting security exploits by being so open about the dependencies? Or is it the <em>right</em> thing to do, as long as I'm using appropriate security auditing tools and not doing anything very obviously dangerous (allowing unfiltered, un-sanitized user input for example).</p>
